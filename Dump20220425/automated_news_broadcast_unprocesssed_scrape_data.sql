Charles had more pace, but he ran out of tyres. It may be different tomorrow, but today it worked out ok and I was happy to have a clean race.”\nLeclerc was philosophical.\n“It’s still a front row start,” he said.  “I struggled with the tyres, with graining on the front left so we have to work to come back stronger tomorrow. The support here for Ferrari is amazing.”\nMercedes struggled again despite an improved showing in second practice.\nOn a difficult track for overtaking, George Russell came in 11th and seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton 14th, positions once seemed unimaginable for the multi-championship winning team.\nOn a bright, dry afternoon, Leclerc made an excellent start and swept past pole-sitter Verstappen to lead into Tamburello with Norris third ahead of Magnussen, on medium tyres, and Perez.\nBehind the front-runners, Zhou Guanyu tried to pass Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri on the outside of Piratella, but made contact and spun off into a wall.\nHis Alfa Romeo was badly damaged, but he was unhurt while Gasly suffered a puncture.\nThis collision prompted a Safety Car intervention while the debris was cleared. After four laps, the racing resumed with Magnussen given a black-and-white warning flag for weaving in front of Perez on the straight.\nTo the delight of the ‘tifosi’ crowded around the circuit, Leclerc drove with text-book perfection to remain clear of Verstappen while the two Mercedes, much-improved in the earlier second practice session, struggled to advance.\nBy lap 11, Leclerc led by 1.4 seconds with Perez charging through to third, six seconds adrift, Norris fourth and a charging Ricciardo up to fifth ahead of Sainz, also on a charge for Ferrari, and Magnussen.\nSainz soon passed Ricciardo for fifth, making use of his Drag Reduction System (DRS) at Tamburello, while up front Verstappen closed up on Leclerc, who was struggling with graining of his front right tyre.\nWith four laps remaining, the Ferrari led by seven-tenths, but had to repel the Red Bull’s attacks under braking at Tamburello for the next two laps before Verstappen went round the outside to take the lead.\nSainz, who had a miserable weekend in Melbourne and a crash in Friday practice, demonstrated his bold recovery powers by taking Norris for fourth after starting from 10th on the grid.\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2022\n','Published April 24, 2022 -

His tally of 5,295 runs as skipper is the highest by an England captain. He scored 1,708 test runs in 2021, including six Test centuries.\nStokes thanked Root for his support as captain, saying their relationship went  “deeper and further” than just team-mates and they have been  “good friends” for a long time. Stokes said Root called him to inform of his decision.\n“As you can imagine it was quite an emotional conversation, but it wasn’t a long chat, there will be time for that in the future,” he continued. “This was an emotional few minutes and in return there was nothing but love, respect and support from me because that is what Joe Root has shown me throughout his time as England Test captain.”\nEngland appointed former batter Rob Key as the managing director of the men’s cricket team while Stokes, who was Root’s deputy, has been tipped as a favourite to become the next captain.\n“Clearly as vice-captain and someone who has stood in on a few occasions my name will be strongly talked about,” Stokes added.\n“But all I will say is that it is a huge honour to captain England and whoever does it will get to enjoy that responsibility of trying to take the team forward.”\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2022\n','Published April 24, 2022 - Updated about 11 hours ago','https://i.dawn.com/medium/2022/04/62592b03d99f6.jpg','24/04/2022','22:11:53'),(6,6,'‘Delight and disbelief’ as Abid makes comeback after heart ailment\n',' \nKARACHI: Walking in to bat in his first competitive cricket match after four months, Abid Ali felt a mixture of delight and disbelief.\nAbid’s world had turned upside down when he was diagnosed for acute coronary syndrome which threatened to put his flourishing Test career on hold.\nThis week, he finally made his comeback. Not at international level but in a Ramzan T20 tournament in Faisalabad. Just being able to come back and bat has been some journey for the 34-year-old.\nIn December last year, Abid had returned home after a successful tour of Bangladesh where he played a key role in Pakistan’s 2-0 Test series triumph and was looking forward to the remainder of the domestic season for Central Punjab.\nOn December 21, in the Quaid Trophy match against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the UBL Sports Complex here, Abid experienced pain around his chest and shoulder while batting on the last day.\nHe complained about the discomfort to his team’s physiotherapist Dr. Asad, who medicated him but it did not work.\nFew minutes after returning to the crease, Abid told the umpires he wanted to retire and while walking off, he vomited before being taken to a private hospital in the city.\nFollowing ECG tests at the hospital, the doctors concluded that Abid was going through a heart condition and that there was blockage in one of his arteries.\n“Initially, I was shocked,”Abid told Dawn on Friday, recalling the moment when the doctors revealed to him their diagnosis after his angioplasty. “I couldn’t contemplate what was happening with me.”\nAt that point, Abid had convinced himself that after making it to the international level at 31, his career was already over after just 16 Tests and six One-day Internationals.\nHad it not been for the people around him during that difficult time, which included 20 days of rehabilitation period at the hospital, he might have never hoped again.\n“The doctors, the nurses and the hospital staff; all of them told me that I can play again,” said Abid. “All of them wanted me to be an example for people who go through such difficulties.”\nAbid’s colleagues, former players, Pakistan Cricket Board officials and journalists, he said, reached out to him to extend support and motivate him.\n“There were times when I thought my career was over, but I knew I needed a different mindset,” said the Lahore-born right-hander. “Whenever I felt negative, I readily switched myself to a positive mindset and kept faith in God.”\nThree months into his recovery period Australia visited Pakistan for three Tests, as many ODIs and a solitary T20 game. It was the side’s first tour to the country after 24 years and Abid, who would have been an automatic selection for the Tests, had been waiting for it.\n“I did feel sad not being a part of the team in the Australia Tests,” he said. “I think it was God’s will and I’ve no complaints. I’m happy for my team-mates who made their dream of playing at home in such an important series come true.”\nOn the day Pakistan’s first Test against Australia kicked off, Abid started training in the nets, being told my doctors that he will be able to return to full activity in the next three months.\n“The staff at the National High-Performance Center, the coaches and the doctors backed me fully during that time and assured me a comeback wasn’t far away,” he said.\nTurning out for Faisalabad Knights in the Saga Premier League on Wednesday, Abid celebrated his comeback with shots all around the ground as he scored a 32-ball 50. He pulled and cut on the back foot, drove and flicked on the front and danced down the wicket to clear the boundary.\nThe maximum came after a length delivery by Pakistan discard Mohammad Talha smashed into his helmet. Abid took the blow and carried on. That’s exactly what he’s done in the last four months.\n“My happiness and excitement was more than what a kid feels when he is allowed to go outside to play,” said the veteran of 130 first class matches.\nWhat the future holds for Abid is something he isn’t contemplating just yet. After all that he has gone through, he understands life is more than just cricket and the fame that comes with it.\n“I can only try my best, the rest is in God’s hands,” he said. “I feel life is all about being a nice person, being closer to God, helping people who need you and forgiving the ones you’re not happy with.”\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2022\n','Published April 23, 2022 - Updated a day ago','https://i.dawn.com/primary/2022/04/62631810ec182.jpg','24/04/2022','22:12:12'),(7,7,'Wimbledon ban will ‘incite hatred,’ says Belarus federation\n','LONDON: The decision to bar Russian and Belarusian players from Wimbledon over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine will incite  “hatred and intolerance”, the Belarus Tennis Federation (BTF) said, adding that they are seeking legal advice on the ban. \nThe grasscourt major announced on Wednesday that Russian and Belarusian competitors would be banned from this year’s tournament. Belarus is a key staging area for the invasion, which Russia calls a “special military operation”. \n“The Belarusian Tennis Federation categorically condemns the decision of the Wimbledon organizers to suspend the Belarusian and Russian tennis players,” BTF said in a statement on Thursday. “Such destructive actions in no way contribute to the resolution of conflicts, but only incite hatred and intolerance on ethnic grounds.” \nThe decision means that Belarusian players including fourth-ranked Aryna Sabalenka and two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka will not be able to compete at the June 27-July 10 tournament. \nThe BTF also criticised initial UK government plans to force Russian and Belarusian players to sign statements condemning the war as a pre-condition of being allowed to play at Wimbledon. \nThis showed “incompetence and ignorance”, they said. \n“Illegal decisions of international tennis organisations in relation to our athletes undermine, first of all, the reputation of these organisations, and the inconsistency of statements and actions between them only confirm the incompetence and unilateral decision-making,” the BTF added. \n“BTF management is still consulting with international law firms on sports law and developing a strategy that is aimed primarily at protecting the Belarusian tennis players around the world and tennis in the Republic of Belarus in general.” \nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club’s (AELTC) decision has been criticised by the ATP and WTA Tours, though it said it would “consider and respond accordingly” if circumstances change between now and June. \nOn Friday, Olympic champion Alexander Zverev joined the chorus of criticism against the decision by the organisers of Wimbledon. \nThe 25-year-old Zverev, currently ranked third in the world, said he sees “no reason why” players from Russia or Belarus “shouldn’t play in Wimbledon”. \nAt the moment, players representing the two countries are allowed to take part in ATP and WTA events but are barred from competing under the name or flag of their countries. \nZverev says “it’s absolutely correct” that Russian and Belarussian teams are banned from tennis competitions. \nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) has already barred both countries from the Davis Cup and the Billie Jean King Cup. \n“That is something against Russia, I understand that,” added Zverev as he prepares for next week’s ATP tournament in Munich. “I think we are all against the war, what is happening in Ukraine is inhumane and shouldn’t be happening.” \nZverev was born in Hamburg to Russian parents. \nHe stood up for his close friend, Russia’s Andrey Rublev, who on Thursday blasted the decision by Wimbledon officials as “complete discrimination”. \nThe decision means Rublev as well as players like compatriot and world number two Daniil Medvedev sit out the June 27-July 10 tournament. \n“I have spoken to Andrey,” said Zverev, who pointed out Rublev has already taken a stand against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. \nAt the Dubai tournament in February, Rublev had scribbled “No war please” on a courtside TV camera after a victory. \n“He [Rublev] is also ready to help Ukraine,” added Zverev. “He is ready to oppose the war, he is ready to send his prize money to Ukraine.”  \nLikewise, US tennis trailblazer Billie Jean King, a founder of the WTA in 1973, also spoke out against the decision. \n“I cannot support the banning of individual athletes from any tournament, simply because of their nationality,” she said. \nUkraine’s top female player Elina Svitolina had said she feels that Russian and Belarusian players who do speak out against the invasion “should be allowed” to compete at Wimbledon. \n“We don’t want them banned completely,” Svitolina said in an interview with the BBC on Thursday. “If players don’t speak out against the Russian government then it is the right thing to ban them. \n“We just want them to speak up, if they are with us and the rest of the world or the Russian government. This is for me the main point. \n“If they didn’t choose, didn’t vote for this government, then it’s fair they should be allowed to play and compete.”\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2022\n','Published April 23, 2022 - Updated a day ago','https://i.dawn.com/primary/2022/04/6263937aaad98.jpg','24/04/2022','22:12:28'),(8,8,'Verstappen takes pole in qualifying at Emilia Romagna GP\n','IMOLA: Formula One world champion Max Verstappen put Red Bull on pole position in a wet and crash-interrupted Emilia Romagna Grand Prix qualifying on Friday to secure top slot for the first sprint of the season.\nThe pole was his first of the 2022 campaign.\nFerrari’s championship leader Charles Leclerc, thwarted by a late stoppage, will line up alongside the Dutchman on the front row for Saturday’s 100km race to decide who starts first in Sunday’s main Grand Prix at Imola.\nVerstappen goes into the Formula One record books as the pole setter for the weekend, however, regardless of where he starts on Sunday.\nThe winner of the sprint will take eight points instead of the three available at each of last season’s three such weekends.\nLeclerc has a 34 point lead over Mercedes’ George Russell in the championship after winning two of the three rounds to date and taking all three bonus points available for fastest laps.\nEach of Friday’s three qualifying phases had to be halted after incidents, with the red flags brought out five times in total and the pole contenders ultimately splashing around on intermediate tyres and with plumes of spray.\nThe final one, triggered by McLaren’s Lando Norris becoming stuck in the gravel runoff, brought an end to the proceedings with 38 seconds remaining and the Briton qualifying a strong third.\nKevin Magnussen was fourth for Haas, ahead of Alpine’s Fernando Alonso and McLaren’s Daniel Ricciardo with Red Bull’s Sergio Perez seventh and Valtteri Bottas eighth for Alfa Romeo.

A fierce competitor, his 21-year career was defined by moments where he led a talented but volatile bunch of cricketers to improbable wins.\nRelegated to the sidelines after making his debut in 1971, Khan remodelled himself as a genuine fast bowler and came back to erase all doubts about his ability as an international cricketer. He would go onto become one of the greatest all-rounders in the game.\nThe pinnacle of his career was undoubtedly the 1992 World Cup win, where he battled through injuries to spur a young side to triumph.\nAs Khan turns 63 today, here\'s a look at his dazzling career in headlines:\nRamiz Raja on Imran Khan\'s determination to win the 92 World Cup\nThere was only one guy who was 100% sure, every time we won or lost any game, that we would win this World Cup. That was our captain. After a while, we thought it wasn’t possible because we had to rely on another team losing to qualify for the semifinals. And it happened that way! It was a dream come true, it was a great moment.\nGeoff Boycott on Imran the leader\nAny question on captaincy for me, Imran Khan is my favourite, always. Everything he did, nearly always, trying for wickets… when he had the legspinner Abdul Qadir, he really didn\'t like to bowl him negatively, tried to bowl him to get wickets all the time. And quite frankly, he had to be so strong, aggressive and positive because anybody who\'s having to handle a Pakistan team is going to have to act like God. That is probably the toughest job in world cricket.\nWasim Akram on learning the art of bowling from Imran Khan\nI always followed his advice because I needed somebody to guide me, give me confidence for the ball I was about to bowl…aur Imran say behtar to koi bowler tha hi nahi confidence bharanay kai liyay (and there was no better bowler than Imran when you needed a confidence boost).\nWest Indies great Viv Richards on Imran Khan\nHe was one of the fiercest competitors and, no matter how well you were batting, he would always have a delivery which could come and destroy you. I respect him and his cricketing views; and if the Pakistani side had a leader they looked up to and respected like they did him, they would be a much better and more consistent team than they are now. \nAaqib Javed on how Imran Khan turned Pakistan\'s fortunes at the 92 World Cup\nWe then went to Perth for our match against Australia. It was almost impossible for an Asian side to beat Australia at Perth but that was our day. Just before the match, Imran came into the dressing room, spoke for about 20 minutes and turned our psyche around for the rest of the tournament.\nHe instilled a belief in us. He had this unique quality, a quality that every leader must have: to make people believe in what he is saying.\nThe late Tony Greig on Imran Khan\'s leadership\nWhen Imran was captain, there was never question of anyone else being in charge. And that more than anything, won them the 1992 World Cup.\nMartin Crowe on Imran Khan the all-rounder\nHe was the greatest all-rounder since Gary Sobers\nImran Khan on his toughest opponent, Viv Richards:\nOf all the players in my time, Viv Richards stood out as the greatest. He was a complete genius. Viv was the only batsman who would attack me. No other batsman could attack me when I was at my peak.\nFamous Imran Khan quotes\n“I want my team to play today like a cornered tiger when it\'s at its most dangerous.”\n“I have always believed that one should not be scared of losing, I think that really is the key.”\n“I believed in myself.

Look up who chairs the boards of widely successful football clubs in Europe, and all you’d find are businessmen, lawyers, former brand executives and whatnot. You would struggle to find a former athlete with 15 months of unremarkable administrative experience, and none in the past 17 years, heading the entire operation. \nEven Saurav Ganguly cut his administrative teeth a tier below and headed the Cricket association of Bengal for five years before given the nod to lead the BCCI.\nSports administration today is a specialised field that is taught at universities and needs specific knowledge and nous.

A “relatively small number of protons” were circulated at an energy of 450 billion electronvolts, CERN said.\n“High-intensity, high-energy collisions are a couple of months away,” the head of CERN’s beams department Rhodri Jones said.\nCERN said its experts “will work around the clock” to get the collider ready to set a new record of 13.6 trillion electronvolts.\nThe unprecedented number of upcoming collisions will also serve as the starting gun for four years of massive data collection and analysis by CERN’s four huge particle detectors.\n‘Exciting few years’\nThe Large Hadron Collider’s observation of the Higgs boson was seen as further verification of the Standard Model, which is the best theory scientists have for the most basic building blocks of the universe and what forces govern them.\nBut the collider’s new phase of exploration comes at an interesting time, with the Standard Model coming under pressure by a series of measurements that do not seem to fit within its framework.\nEarlier this month more than 400 scientists said that after a decade of measuring they had found that the W boson has a significantly greater mass than the Standard Model allowed for.\nHarry Cliff, a particle physicist at Cambridge University, said the collider’s upgrade means “it’s going to be an exciting few years”.\nThere are currently four known fundamental forces of nature — gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces — and a fifth would be a “really big deal,” he said.\nAnother explanation could be that we know less than we thought.\nIt could be that “we’re actually looking at one corner of the picture, and there’s a much bigger picture where the Standard Model makes a lot of sense,” Cliff said. Either way, it would “be a step on a road to a more unified understanding of the basic ingredients of the universe,” he said.\nOne of the biggest holes in the Standard Model is that it fails to account for dark matter, which is thought to make up a significant amount of the universe.\nSo far the Large Hadron Collider has found no signs of dark matter.\n“By its nature it’s hard to detect,” Cliff said.

Pandemic-driven lockdowns that drove binge-watching have lifted while deep-pocketed rivals such as Apple and Walt Disney began to chip away at its vast audience with their own streaming services.\nNetflix’s customer base fell by 200,000 subscribers during the January-March quarter, the first contraction it had seen since the streaming service became available throughout most of the world outside of China six years ago. The drop stemmed in part from Netflix’s decision to withdraw from Russia to protest the war against Ukraine, resulting in a loss of 700,000 subscribers. Netflix projected a loss of another 2 million subscribers in the current April-June quarter.\n \nThe erosion, coming off a year of progressively slower growth, has rattled another key constituency for Netflix — its shareholders. After revealing its disappointing performance, Netflix shares plunged by more than 25 per cent in extended trading. If the stock drop extends into Wednesday’s regular trading session, Netflix shares will have lost more than half of their value so far this year — wiping out about $150 billion in shareholder wealth in less than four months.\nAptus Capital Advisors analyst David Wagner said it’s now clear that Netflix is grappling with an imposing challenge. “They are in no-(wo) man’s land,” Wagner wrote in a research note Tuesday.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company estimated that about 100 million households worldwide are watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member, including 30 million in the US and Canada. “Those are over 100 million households already are choosing to view Netflix,” Hastings said. “We’ve just got to get paid at some degree for them.”\nTo prod more people to pay for their own accounts, Netflix indicated it will expand a trial program it has been running in three Latin American countries — Chile, Costa Rica and Peru. In these locations, subscribers can extend service to another household for a discounted price. In Costa Rica, for instance, Netflix plan prices range from $9 to $15 a month, but subscribers can openly share their service with another household for $3.\nNetflix offered no additional information about how a cheaper ad-supported service tier would work or how much it would cost. Another rival, Hulu, has long offered an ad-supported tier.\nWhile Netflix clearly believes these changes will help it build upon its current 221.6 million worldwide subscribers, the moves also risk alienating customers to the point they cancel the service.\nNetflix was previously stung by a customer backlash in 2011 when it unveiled plans to begin charging for its then-nascent streaming service, which has previously been bundled for free with its traditional DVD-by-mail service before its international expansion. In the months after that change, Netflix lost 800,000 subscribers, prompting a apology from Hastings for botching the execution of the spin-off.\nTuesday’s announcement was a sobering comedown for a company that was buoyed two years ago when millions of consumers corralled at home were desperately seeking diversions — a void Netflix was happy to fill. Netflix added 36 million subscribers during 2020, by far the largest annual growth since its video streaming service’s debut in 2007.\nBut Netflix CEO Reed Hastings now believes those outsized gains may have blinded management. “COVID created a lot of noise on how to read the situation,” he said in a video conference Tuesday.\nNetflix began heading in a new direction last year when its service added video games at no additional charge in an attempt to give people another reason to subscribe.\nEscalating inflation over the past year has also squeezed household budgets, leading more consumers to rein in their spending on discretionary items. Despite that pressure, Netflix recently raised its prices in the US, where it has its greatest household penetration — and where it’s had the most trouble finding more subscribers.\nIn the most recent quarter, Netflix lost 640,000 subscribers in the US and Canada, prompting management to point out that most of its future growth will come in international markets. Netflix ended March with 74.6 million subscribers in the US and Canada.\n','Published April 20, 2022','https://i.dawn.com/primary/2022/04/625fa564ef229.jpg','24/04/2022','22:25:06'),(55,55,'Twitter adopts ‘poison pill’ to fight takeover by Musk\n','BENGALURU: Twitter Inc on Friday adopted a limited-duration shareholder rights plan to protect itself from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s $43 billion cash takeover offer.\nMusk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter — the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders — and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday.\nAfter his TED talk on Thursday, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter’s board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: “It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.” Under the plan, also known as a ‘poison pill’ strategy to resist a bid from a potential acquirer, the rights will become exercisable if anyone acquires ownership of 15 per cent or more of Twitter’s outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board.\nThe rights plan will expire on April 14, 2023, Twitter said.\nAccording to analysts and shareholder activists, Musk could alter the course of the social media company as the management battles a set of proxy proposals focused on topics from civil rights to politics at its upcoming annual meeting.\nWhatever the outcome of Musk’s bid to buy Twitter outright announced on Thursday, investors with opposing political views described the billionaire entrepreneur as likely to work to undo some of the restrictions on content that Twitter has imposed as it attempts to promote free speech while combating hate speech and false information.\nEven if he fails to buy Twitter, the Tesla CEO, who recently disclosed a 9.6 per cent stake, is seen as likely to vote in ways that could shake up the company at its virtual May 25 meeting, said people who follow corporate governance issues.\n“Given where Musk has positioned himself relative to the strategy of Twitter and given he wants to be something of a disrupter, I don’t see him voting with management very often,” said Brian Bueno of Farient Advisors, a corporate governance and executive pay consulting firm.\nMusk said his offer price of $54.20 per share was meant to promote open discourse. At the virtual meeting, he will control the second-largest stake after Vanguard Group, enough to give either investor a kingmaker role in close contests.\nMusk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how he might vote at Twitter.\nMusk’s star power will likely draw much attention to event, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “He’s a well-known individual in the middle of all this, so it will increase the interest in voting and could have a big impact,” Elson said.\nAlthough Twitter on Friday adopted a shareholder rights plan to defend itself against Musk, Elson said its impact on the voting might only be to make proxy advisers, which tend to frown on such so-called “poison pills,” more skeptical of management.\nTwitter faces five shareholder proposals, all opposed by management, dealing with topics drawing much investor attention.\nTwo are from conservative groups, one asking Twitter to report on its impact on civil rights and the other on its lobbying activities.

The offer is non-binding and subject to financing and other conditions.\n“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Musk said in the filing. “However, since making my investment I now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.”\nTwitter said it has received Musk’s offer and will decide whether it is in the best interests of shareholders to accept or continue to operate as a publicly-traded company.\nAnalyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush said in a client note that he believes “this soap opera will end with Musk owning Twitter after this aggressive hostile takeover of the company.” He thinks it would be hard for any other bidders or consortium to come forward and said Twitter’s board will likely be forced to accept Musk’s offer or start a process to sell the company.\nThe billionaire has been a vocal critic of Twitter in recent weeks, mostly over his belief that it falls short of free speech principles. The social media platform has angered followers of Donald Trump and other far-right political figures who’ve had their accounts suspended for violating its content standards on violence, hate or harmful misinformation. Musk, who has described himself as a “free speech absolutist”, also has a history of his own tweets causing legal problems.\nHe didn’t explain why, but the decision coincided with a barrage of now-deleted tweets from Musk proposing major changes to the company, such as dropping ads — its chief source of revenue — and transforming its San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter. Musk left a few clues on Twitter about his thinking, such as by “liking” a tweet that summarised the events as Musk going from “largest shareholder for Free Speech” to being “told to play nice and not speak freely”.\nMusk’s 81 million Twitter followers make him one of the most popular figures on the platform, rivalling pop stars like Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga. But his prolific tweeting has sometimes gotten him into trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and others.\nMusk and Tesla in 2018 agreed to pay $40m in civil fines and for Musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share. That didn’t happen, but the tweet caused Tesla’s stock price to jump. Musk’s latest trouble with the SEC could be his delay in notifying regulators of his growing stake in Twitter.\nShares of Twitter jumped 11pc before the market opened.

He figured out very early that he did not want to go to a university. He then planned to get an ACCA degree and decided to become an auditor. But this did not work out.\nThinking that a career as a rock guitarist might be the thing for him because he had participated in several school gigs before, he decided to try his luck in singing. But Mr Bilal was counselled by his father who being a good mentor told him he would not be able to have a stable career in singing, rather he should utilise his other talent, in computers.\nHe first used a computer when he was only 5 years old. This was where his passion for the world of computing began.\nThen, a friend from England told him to take a certification in Cisco and work in networking technology. He went on to complete two CCIE certifications.\nStill 21 years of age, he was used to getting many job offers. He even turned down the offer of a big telecommunication company in Saudi Arabia and rather chose to do a job in Beaconhouse. But thankfully within six months of his work there, he realised that his talent was being wasted and his job role was not utilising his Cisco expertise at all.\nA company from Abu Dhabi called him to give training sessions in Cisco. This company also specialised in disaster recovery solutions. After gaining some experience, Mr Bilal left the company to form his own company – Ikhtira Systems – in Multan, a city chosen specifically because there was no competition in disaster recovery services there. Lahore already had so many companies doing similar work. His company’s name ‘Ikhtira’ was taken from a band he was a part of in high school. But just like the band, the company suffered heavy losses and failed within 10 months of operations.\nMr Bilal was distraught; he did not want to go back home and ask his parents for support. People used to look up to him and appreciate the fact that he started a company at 22, and now they were making fun of him. He did not even have money to buy lunch for three consecutive days.\nFreelancing pays\nDestiny then led him to a guy who told him to start freelancing on the Internet. He had a network of very supportive friends in Multan. Even though, he did not have money to buy his own Internet service, being the geeky genius he was, he started hacking into other people’s Wi-Fi. Freelancing started making him some money. He got his first project in 10 days and although he only made $35 for his first project, he was relieved that at least now, he was earning something. “Things then started moving in a good direction. Freelancing really helped,” he recalls.\nWith the confidence of some money in his pocket, he went back home and started living with his family in Vehari. But his parents were upset with his routine. He used to sleep all day and work all night. His parents worried that no girl would marry him if he continued like this. Mr Bilal then got the opportunity to move to Lahore. He started helping Arfa Karim’s parents in setting up their institution in Plan9. He didn’t charge them any money, just utilised the space for his own work. By this time, he had started working on Wifigen already.\nGetting breakthroughs\nDuring his freelancing gigs, Mr Bilal got a project from someone who turned out to be John Russell Patrick, the ex-VP of IBM. He pitched Wifigen’s idea to him, but although John liked the idea, he said that he did not invest in early-stage companies. Mr Bilal was nonetheless adamant that Mr John could at least mentor him. Thus, began the journey of a mentor turning into an investor.\nMr Bilal then went on to do a project for another lady who had her own consultancy company in New Zealand. She introduced him to someone who wanted to be a reseller for this product in New Zealand, but was told to complete the product in two months. Mr Bilal argued that he needed funds to complete it in such a short period. The reseller in New Zealand agreed to fund the project without taking any equity. A lucky break, you may call it. He then hired some people on freelancer.com to help him build his product within 45 days. The proposed timeline for project completion was 60 days. This left a 15 days leverage to further test the product and eradicate any flaws.\nBut that was not enough for him. He was surprised to find that anyone could apply at Plan9. It was a very open community that really motivated him. He went on to launch his own company in New Zealand. Within three months of incubation, he raised funding from his old mentor, Mr John.\nThen during a business trip to Singapore, he met a representative from Changi Airport who was really interested in deploying Wifigen on their airport. Mr Bilal then started beta testing Wifigen on Singapore’s airport. Later on, he got Unilever Pakistan on board too. But this was only the beginning. He signed on the biggest deal in the history of Wi-Fi at Tahiti Island, which wanted to use Wifigen to give a better experience to tourists. Wifigen then was seen as a product with a huge application in the tourism industry.\nWhat’s next?\nMr Bilal has been trying to integrate artificial intelligence with Wi-Fi for the last three months. He realises that machine learning is necessary to make things easy for the advertisers and the people who will be using its Wi-Fi. It will allow the advertisers to know exactly who the end user is and how deep his pockets are, so they can accordingly pitch them different products.\nHe wishes to move into more markets as business expansion will be the key driver of Wifigen’s success. His company currently has a multi-million dollar valuation while trying to raise another round of investment. For all those aspiring entrepreneurs out there, he has only one thing to say: “Keep failing until you are ready to change the world.”\n','Published July 22, 2016','https://i.dawn.com/primary/2016/07/5791be15ac732.jpg','24/04/2022','22:26:33'),(61,61,'Freelancers in Pakistan can now receive funds in real time.

It does not sell cellphone on its own. The website, still in its beta version, is actually a service that allows users to compare cellphone prices from different Pakistani online stores. Once a user selects a handset, the website displays a list of e-stores where the product is available. By clicking on the tab of a particular store, the user is taken to that store\'s website where the order can be placed. \nSmartphones are the largest online selling product in Pakistan, which is why PriceOye started with cellphones. The need to expand to other products in the future has also been mentioned, but for now, the website only deals with cellphones.\nCredible and up to date\nApart from gathering prices from different online stores, PriceOye also makes sure that prices are always up to date and the offers are credible – two things that other online stores aren’t always able to ensure. It does so by implementing an automatic system that keeps a check on prices offered by legitimate online stores. \nPriceOye also has user-friendly website, with a straightforward presentation of products. It has filters that help narrow down handsets based on price, screen size, processor, camera quality, storage, and operating systems. The website also shows a chart displaying weekly changes in prices of a cellphone. \nRoom for improvement\nWhile general browsing is smooth, the website still needs to be more flexible. \nFor example, you can only search for the phones by brand and compare the prices between different stores. There is no option to compare different phones in the same price brackets. You can know how much a Samsung phone is available for, but you cannot know what kind of phones are available and where for, let’s say, RS35000-50000. \nAbsence of such crucial feature could be deal breaker for some. It’s more efficient to have all your results on one page instead of having to go through five or six pages. An improvement on this front would save users a lot of frustration. As for the mobile version of the website, it does not have all the features yet.\nPriceOye is a welcome addition to the growing number of online stores in Pakistan.

Will it be augmented reality, auto, wearables?

We find out','Newly launched Android game ‘Pak Truck Driver’ is arguably the most exciting driving game to have come out of Pakistan. By putting you behind the wheel of a beautifully decorated truck, it takes you through Pakistan’s breathtaking mountain ranges. \nYour task is to carry consignments from one location to another while ensuring minimum damage to the shipment. The narrow and dangerous roads, lofty speed breakers, and tricky curves add to difficulty and excitement.\nThe trucking experience of course, is not complete without the flamboyant truck horns and folk music in the background; and ‘Apex Logics’, the developers behind the game, have incorporated these elements into the game with style. \nThumbs up for game play\n\'Pak Truck Driver\' is crafted to incentivise good performance. \nYou have two trucks in your garage but you must use only one to clear five levels before you earn keys to the second truck. \nThe game is based on one long, continuous road, which is divided into multiple stops, through the mountains. \nMuch like in real life, careless driving in the game will not only knock the goods out of your truck, but it will also cost you a life [in the game].\nOverall, the game is simple but the last few levels stand out as much more challenging than the rest.\nThe 3D graphics are fairly pleasant. The blue sky, rocky, snow-top mountains, green pastures are a leaf out of one the world’s most beautiful destinations.\nMore positives: You are in control\nIt is always good to have multiple camera angles, although every time you end up sticking to one that gives you more control. \n\'Pak Truck Driver\' gives you the options of being the truck\'s driver and viewing your decked out truck rumble through the terrain from a slightly more distant angle. \nNot to worry – the different camera angles have no bearing over the game play.\nCarrying logs, barrels, and boxes to their destination safely is the central theme of the game.\nThe suspension of the truck is fairly responsive. The truck reacts, as they do, when you apply the brakes or take sharp turns. \nWhat more; the tilt-to-turn feature may end up helping you burn a couple of calories!\nThe signature Pakistani truck horn is right there to be used. It may not have much use in the game but blowing it is fun nevertheless. \nPerhaps that is just the nature of our horns.\nThe downside: Unwanted banners\nOf course this isn\'t the perfect truck driving game.\nOstensibly, banners and ads are the bread and butter of game developers but it isn\'t wise to have a banner pop up during game play. \nIt affects your performance adversely, and causes unwanted hindrance. \nThere is also a fair bit of room for improvement in the graphics department.\nThe back of the truck seems paper thin, the speedometer needle doesn’t move, and the dashboard is unrealistically flat and bland.\nTo expect subtlety in Pakistani truck art is plain naivety, yet it feels that the game developers went a bit over-the-top in painting those trucks. \nSome advice\nWhile \'Pak Truck Driver\' is a must-have for those into driving games, the developers can do a bit more to add quality to the player’s experience.  \nIt would be useful to have a scoring system based on the time travelled along integration with Google Play to track records and progress of the players. \nNewer locations, fresher terrains, and a wider variety of trucks are the requirements of this game. \nAnother feature that could have been improved was the presence of other cars on the roads, as it would be an effective way to increase difficulty and make the experience more exciting for the player.\nNonetheless, this is a novel idea which is executed with style. \nThe author is a graphic designer and freelance writer with a focus on tech.\n','Published August 8,

Etsy, it seemed like the perfect match: a tech platform for small traders to sell handmade items that promised to be a creative outlet and bring tidy profits.\nFive years later, Jak is one of the thousands in open rebellion against the place they once saw as a safe haven — part of a growing trend of users rising up against tech platforms.\n\"We were lured in with the \'shop small\' slogans and low fees and useful marketplace, and then once everyone had built their stores up, they started to tighten their grip and bleed us dry,\" said the 30-year-old, who runs an online shop from Glasgow in Scotland and asked their surname not be used.\nNew York-based Etsy, which boasts sales of $5 billion a year from around five million sellers and 90 million buyers, drew fury for hiking the fees it charges its small traders.\nMore than 10,000 of its sellers closed their shops for a week from April 11, in effect going on strike.\nIt came weeks after users of video-sharing platform Vimeo expressed outrage at a similar price hike, and users of social media platform OnlyFans forced the owners to abandon a proposal to ban explicit content.\nAmazon has had countless battles with its sellers -- a recent survey in Germany concluded almost 80% were unhappy with their relationship with the e-commerce giant.\nAnd Uber faces frequent unrest -- Indian drivers are currently refusing to turn on air-conditioning in protest at spiralling fuel prices and low fares.\n\"We\'re entering a period of revolt and rebellion now,\" said Vili Lehdonvirta, a professor from Oxford University who tackles the power of tech platforms in a forthcoming book \"Cloud Empires\".\nWhile he reckons many of these rebellions have a limited chance of short-term success, the long-term outlook is not a foregone conclusion.\n\'Etsy gouges us\'\nThe breaking point for Etsy sellers was a letter from the firm announcing the platform would take a 6.5% cut on each sale instead of 5%.\nThe rationale, according to the firm, was to invest in marketing and entice more buyers.\nKristi Cassidy, who sells gothic-style costumes and wedding dresses from Rhode Island in the United States, spearheaded the campaign to overhaul the new policy.\n\"Rather than rewarding the sellers whose hard work has enabled Etsy to become one of the most profitable tech companies in the world, Etsy gouges us, ignores us and patronizes us,\" she wrote in an online petition now boasting more than 80,000 signatures.\nSellers from around the world rallied to her call and complaints began to flood social media.\n\"I live in constant fear of getting a reserve put on my account,\" said Jak.\nEtsy can withhold or \"reserve\" a percentage of a seller\'s income for up to 90 days if they suspect sales are not legitimate.\n\"They can seemingly do this for any reason they fancy,\" Jak said.\nOther sellers accused the platform of allowing the marketplace to be flooded with sweatshop-produced tat, or imposing an onerous surveillance system.\nEtsy boss Josh Silverman told the Wall Street Journal recently that the firm was always listening to its sellers and made changes only to benefit them.\n\"When we look at our fees compared to other platforms... we think it\'s a very fair value exchange,\" he said.\n\'Boiling a frog\'\nLehdonvirta has seen this pattern before, particularly with Amazon and eBay.\nTech platforms create walled gardens where buyers and sellers are protected from cybercriminals and fraudsters, and standards of quality are guaranteed.\nThen they become too dominant.\n\"We end up in a situation where they are the de facto rulers of online commerce and now they\'re starting to turn on their people -- like all autocrats throughout history,\" he said.\nLabour market specialist Werner Eichhorst of German think tank IZA said tech firms like Etsy, Uber and food-delivery outfits operated \"highly ambiguous\" systems that allowed \"complete ownership and surveillance power over their clients\".\nBut he said Etsy investors seemed much more interested in profitability than in the wellbeing of sellers, so he would not be surprised if the platform raised its fees still further.\nBoth analysts, though, said that those who rely on platforms for their livelihoods could emerge victorious by joining together in cooperatives or establishing different platforms.\n\"They can get away with slowly boiling a frog, but if there is a perceived transgression of norms, something is done that is just so egregious, then people rise up,\" said Lehdonvirta, suggesting Etsy was at that moment.\nEichhorst also reached for a bleak animal metaphor: \"You cannot milk the cows and at the same time kill them.\"\n','\nApril 24, 2022

What really causes tectonic plates to shift and trigger earthquakes? Scientists visited a remote archipelago in search of answers.\nLocated in the Pacific Ocean several hundred kilometers from the Mexican coast, the Revillagigedo Islands are known as \"Mexico\'s Galapagos\" due to their isolation and biodiversity.\nOne of the archipelago\'s volcanos, Barcena, last erupted spectacularly in 1953, and another Evermann, in 1993. Both remain active today.\nLocated on a mid-ocean ridge, the four islands, which were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2016, are uninhabited apart from navy personnel, and access is tightly restricted.\nGetting there takes about 24 hours or more by boat and few civilians visit apart from scuba drivers lured by giant manta rays, humpback whales, dolphins and sharks.\nLast month, an international team of 10 scientists carried out a week-long mission whose aims included trying to determine if — or more likely when — there will be another volcanic eruption.\n\"What we\'re trying to find is how explosive these volcanos can be and how dangerous,\" said the group\'s leader, Douwe van Hinsbergen, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\nChallenging convention\nThe worry is that something similar to the cataclysmic eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\'apai volcano in January could send a tsunami hurtling towards Mexico\'s Pacific Coast.\n\"Whenever there are active island volcanos, there are always possibilities of generating tsunamis,\" said Pablo Davila Harris, a geologist at Mexico\'s Institute for Scientific and Technological Research of San Luis Potosi.\n\"What we volcanologists are looking for is when the next eruption is going to happen,\" using modeling based on previous volcanic activity, he added.\nThe team also hopes that its analysis of minerals brought up by past eruptions will help to understand the motion of tectonic plates, which cause earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\"Plates move over mantle.

Pakistan became the third country in the world with massive removal of videos from the platform between October 1, 2021, and December 30, 2021.\nThe report reflects the platform’s ongoing commitment to earn trust by being accountable while working to be safe and welcoming. Efforts include fostering authentic engagement across the comment space, safety reminders for creators, and adhering strictly to the extensive community guidelines. \nThe reports showed that 94.1% of videos were removed within 24 hours of being posted for violating community guidelines, while 95.2% were removed before a user reported them and 90.1% were removed before the videos had any views. \nRemoving content at zero views improved by 14.7% for harassment and bullying content, 10.9% for hateful behaviour, 16.2% for violent extremism, and 7.7% for dangerous acts.\nTo date, the steadfast progress on removing content that violates the community guidelines prior to receiving any views improved by 14.7% for harassment and bullying content, 10.9% for hateful behaviour, 16.2% for violent extremism, and 7.7% for dangerous acts.\nA TikTok official said: “At TikTok, we believe our community should be built on a foundation of respect, kindness, and understanding. To help people forge positive digital connections in line with our rules for appropriate behaviour, we strive to empower our users to stay in control of their interactions with others on TikTok. \nThere\'s no finish line when it comes to keeping people safe, and our latest report and continued safety improvements reflect our ongoing commitment to the well-being of our community.”\nAlongside the platform’s work to proactively remove abusive and hateful content or behaviour that violates community guidelines, it is exploring new ways to help everyone feel more in control over comments through authentic engagement. This spans testing ways in which users can identify comments they believe to be irrelevant or inappropriate, such as through disliking comments. \nThe community feedback collated will add to the range of factors already in use to help keep the comment section consistently relevant and a place for genuine engagement. In addition to this, to avoid demoralising creators, only the person who registered a dislike on a comment will be able to see that they have done so.\nTo further streamline finding and using the plethora of built-in safety tools offered, TikTok is experimenting with safety reminders that will guide creators to comment filtering and bulk block and delete options. The reminders will be displayed to creators whose videos appear to be receiving a high proportion of negative comments. \nIn parallel the platform will continue to remove comments that violate its stringent community guidelines, building on the already available tools such as the ability to filter comments on content, delete, and report multiple comments at once. \n','\nApril 22, 2022 ','https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2022-04-22/952346_1213997_tiktok_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:30:05'),(74,74,'Twitter, analysts wary of Musk takeover bid','SAN FRANCISCO: As tempting as access to Elon Musk\'s wealth may be, Twitter is not eager to be ruled by a billionaire known for shooting from the hip with little regard for the consequences.\nThe global one-to-many messaging platform is moving to prevent the Tesla boss from getting his hands on all of Twitter\'s outstanding shares, signalling that worries about where he would lead the company to outweigh the proffered payoff.\n\"It\'s management, the board, that feels something is wrong,\" said Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay.\n\"Musk is essentially an autocrat;

This results in greater compression strength than conventional paving stones that crack under heavy force or prolonged weather exposure.\n\"Because of that, it doesn\'t break,\" said Matee, clapping two of the plastic bricks together sharply.\nIn 2021, they recycled 50 tonnes of plastic but Matee hopes to double that amount this year as production expands.\nBig plans\nThere are limitations.\nOf the seven major types of plastic, only four can be recycled into bricks.\nPET plastic — the kind used in plastic bottles and a major scourge on the environment — is not yet compatible, but they hope to change that.\n\"There is more that can be done, there is more that needs to be done.

Our first area of attack is plastic,\" Matee said.\nHer trailblazing work has attracted accolades and earned another boost earlier this year after she designed a custom gavel for a major UN environment summit where the plastic trash crisis topped the agenda.\nGjenge Makers has also created over 100 direct and indirect jobs through recycling plastic — helping both livelihoods and the environment in a way Matee says wasn\'t possible working with fossil fuels.\n\"Let\'s just say I sleep better,\" she said with a grin.\n','\nMarch 29, 2022 ','https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2022-03-29/945628_5540512_Untitled-1_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:32:43'),(86,86,'Huawei reports record net profit as exec Meng makes public return','BEIJING: Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on Monday reported record profit for 2021, defying the US sanctions aimed at it as executive Meng Wanzhou made her first public appearance since returning to China from Canadian custody.\nThe company has been caught in the crosshairs of a US-China trade and technology rivalry, with the administration of former President Donald Trump moving to cripple it over cybersecurity and espionage concerns.\nThe results, announced in Chinese tech hub Shenzhen, also marked the first return to the limelight of Meng since her high-profile return to China after nearly three years under house arrest in Canada.\nMeng, daughter of CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei, spent the years in Canada fighting extradition to the US, as Washington accused her of defrauding HSBC bank by trying to hide alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.\nShe returned home shortly after two Canadians were released from prison in China, ending a diplomatic row that poisoned ties between Beijing and Ottawa for years.\nHuawei\'s revenue fell by around 29 percent last year to 636.8 billion yuan ($100 billion), as it grappled with US sanctions aimed at blocking access to key technology and supplies.\nBut the slump under US sanctions appears to be slowing, and the company said its net profits hit a new record -- surging 75.9 percent on-year to 113.7 billion yuan.\n\"Despite a revenue decline in 2021, our ability to make a profit and generate cash flows is increasing, and we are more capable of dealing with uncertainty,\" Meng said in Monday\'s statement.\nThe company attributes its profitability to \"improved product portfolios and more efficient internal operations\", with a rise in net profit margin even with gains from the sale of its budget phone brand Honor excluded.\nThe company is not publicly listed and its accounts are not subject to the same audits as companies traded on the stock market.\nHuawei, a supplier of telecom networking gear and smartphone brand, has been struggling since Trump launched a campaign to contain the company in 2018.\nSmartphone sales stalled after the US cut Huawei off from key parts and barred it from using Google\'s Android services.\nLast year Huawei logged 243 billion yuan in consumer business sales -- almost 50 percent down from 2020.\nHuawei has instead tried to shore up other parts of its business, refocusing on the Chinese market and diversifying to encompass enterprise and cloud computing, along with other business segments related to 5G networks.\nRotating chairman Guo Ping said in a speech at the event that Huawei\'s ability to \"survive and thrive\" depends on ongoing investment in development.\n\"Our fight to survive is not over yet,\" Guo said.\n\"No matter what comes our way, we will keep investing.

dollar issued by the US Federal Reserve central bank, like all US bills and coins used now, but in a digital form that is accessible to everyone, not just financial institutions.\nUnlike money deposited in a bank account or spent via apps like Venmo and Apple Pay, it would be registered in the accounts of the Federal Reserve, not a bank.\nAt the same time, the digital dollar would be worth the same as its paper counterpart, a divergence from cryptocurrencies which currently have highly volatile valuations.\nKey questions remain unanswered, like whether a digital dollar would be based on blockchain technology like bitcoin or if it would be linked with some sort of payment card.\nBiden is asking agencies, including the Treasury Department, to examine various issues on the topic.\nIf the government decides to go ahead, it could take \"a number of years\" before we can use a digital dollar -- authorities will have to explore for instance which technology to use, said Darrell Duffie, a digital currencies expert at Stanford University in California.\nWhy launch a digital dollar?\nIt would reduce or even eliminate transaction fees since exchanges would no longer go through banks, bank cards or apps that take commissions on every payment.\nProponents say it would help people without bank accounts, about five per cent of households in the United States, and could make it easier for the government to pay benefits.\nThere are risks like a system failure or a cyberattack, and there are also questions about privacy, as the government could theoretically have access to all transactions.\nThe banking system could also be undermined as banks currently use customers\' deposits to lend to others, and with a digital dollar, they could have less money at their disposal.\nHow will global finance be affected?\nInternational transfers, often slow and expensive to make, could be greatly eased.\nAn operation that currently takes two days to be validated could be done in one hour, said Marc Chandler, a foreign exchange expert for the broker Bannockburn.\nFor Chandler, the geopolitical role of the US dollar would not be upset by the digital version\'s introduction.\nA digital dollar would represent \"a natural evolution rather than a revolution\", he noted, recalling that more than $6.5 trillion are already exchanged in electronic form every day on the foreign exchange market.\nEven if China launches a large-scale digital yuan, as is being discussed, he said he doesn\'t think that changes China\'s role in the world economy as \"there will always be questions of trust, transparency, depth of markets.\"\nFor Stanford\'s Duffie, however, if the United States wants to continue to benefit from the dollar\'s status as the dominant currency in central bank reserves and international payments, it is essential that the government tread cautiously.\n\"The US are going to need to ensure that they stay in a leading position in international forums that discuss standards for making cross-border payments standards for digital currencies,\" he said.\nCan the United States catch up?\nOther countries are already working on digital versions of their own currencies, from the eurozone to India, but \"there is no evidence to suggest being first to market provides any significant or material advantages,\" said Jamiel Sheikh, founder of CBDC Think Tank.\nOn the contrary, failure due to unintended consequences, low usage or other issues can undermine faith in the issuing institution, he noted.\n\"The overwhelming dominance of the dollar gives the US the luxury of learning from... other countries,\" agreed Cornell University professor Eswar Prasad.\n Would the crypto world be turned upside down? -\nIf properly designed, a digital dollar could be more preferable for domestic use than a cryptocurrency, said Duffie.\nFor international transfers, however, he said he was \"sceptical that large central banks like the Fed or the ECB, China or Japan, will give accounts at the central bank to people all over the world.\"\nIf the United States did so, he noted, it could wreck the monetary system of small countries whose people might prefer to use the digital dollar rather than the local currency.\n','\nMarch 10, 2022

Italy\'s data privacy watchdog on Wednesday fined US-based firm Clearview AI 20 million euros (almost $22 million) over its controversial facial recognition software.\nThe watchdog ordered the company

images taken from public websites, from social media to news sites, which it touts as a tool for law enforcement.\nItaly\'s privacy watchdog said that, despite Clearview\'s assertions to the contrary, the firm had allowed the tracking of citizens and people in Italy.\n\"The personal data held by the company, including biometric and geolocation data, are processed unlawfully,\" the watchdog said.\nThe company had also violated several principles of GDPR, a European Union privacy regulation introduced in 2018 to control who can access personal data.\nIn addition to the fine, the watchdog said Clearview should designate an EU representative to act as \"an interlocutor\" with plaintiffs.\nCampaigners have condemned Clearview\'s use of images for being open to abuse, and a number of groups including Privacy International last year filed complaints with data regulators in France, Austria, Italy, Greece and Britain.\nIn December, France\'s privacy watchdog ordered Clearview to delete data on its citizens and cease further collection.\nMeanwhile in June last year, Canada\'s independent parliamentary watchdog ruled that both Clearview\'s database and the use of it by federal

Russia in social media info war','PARIS: Ukraine has succeeded in dominating social media in the first days since the Russian invasion, in an intensifying information war with Moscow that Kyiv so far appears to be winning, analysts say.\nEven as President Volodymyr Zelensky remains bunkered down in Kyiv amid heavy bombardment and the fear of assassination, his government has forced an all-out assault on social media to win supporters for their cause.\nZelensky\'s daily video addresses, usually published with English subtitles, have become viral sensations, while the defence and foreign ministries tout the military resistance of Ukraine in snazzy graphics.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainians have posted videos showing the success of their forces that have become viral trends, including a Ukrainian missile shooting down a Russian helicopter and a Ukrainian farmer towing away captured Russian military hardware on his tractor.\nSelf-shot videos of Ukrainians sobbing amid the ruins of their towns after Russia stepped up bombardments have also gripped people around the world.\nMore unverifiable viral claims have included the so-called \"ghost of Kyiv\", a flying ace said to have downed a dozen Russian warplanes, or the Kyiv woman who purportedly knocked out a Russian drone with a jar of pickled cucumbers.\n\"In the first phase of the conflict, in terms of international opinion, the Ukrainians are clearly ahead in information,\" said Baptiste Robert, founder of Predicta Lab, a French company fighting disinformation.\n\"The most impressive thing is that it is organic,\" he said. \"There is a real desire of the Ukrainians to document this war. When something happens, they pull out their phones.\"\n- \'Readjusting and trying again\' -\nRobert said the majority of pro-Ukraine videos doing the rounds on Twitter are genuine, but there have been claims which subsequent fact-checking proved to be exaggerated.\nIn the early stages of the war, Kyiv hailed as heroes 13 border guards who it said lost their lives defending a tiny Black Sea island after swearing at the Russian forces over the radio.\nThey had in fact all survived, as the Ukrainian authorities later acknowledged. Ukraine\'s embassy in Paris denies any deliberate attempt to mislead, saying \"we don\'t do fake news\".\nRussia, accused of spreading disinformation in the 2016 US election to weigh the balance in favour of Donald Trump, is seen as a past master of such tactics.\nBut here, the balance is weighed against Moscow. In addition to being deeply unpopular in the West, the initial phase of the war has been far from successful for the Kremlin, according to independent observers.\n\"I can see them (the Russians) readjusting, refitting, and trying again\" on the information front, said Emily Harding, deputy director and senior fellow in the international security programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"But it will still take a little while to get things running.\"\nShe said she expected Russia to \"push a lot of disinformation into the ecosystem about how the war is going, showing Ukrainian troops supposedly surrendering\".\n- \'Many Russians buy the narrative\' -\nHowever, Russia does not seem hugely concerned about public opinion outside the country, with efforts focused on keeping domestic support behind President Vladimir Putin.\nTo this end, Russia in the last days shut down the final bastions of free speech media in the country, blocked Facebook and restricted access to Twitter.\n\"It is true that they (the Ukrainians) are winning, but at the end of the day, the audience Putin cares most about is what his own people think about him,\" said Darren Linvill, lead researcher at the Media forensic lab of Clemson University in the United States.\n\"I think many, many Russians buy the narrative.\"\nHe added: \"For every narrative which is pro-Ukrainian, such as stories about Russian soldiers surrendering without fighting and Ukrainian heroes being lauded for their bravery, you see the same thing in Russia, in the conversation among nationalists, for their own side.\"\nWith Ukrainian resistance forcing Moscow into a much longer war than the Kremlin wanted, a new phase in the information war is likely to open up.\nIf more Ukrainian cities fall to Russian forces, \"there will be a new information war between those areas still resisting and the counter-information that the Russians are imposing,\" said Robert.\n','\nMarch 06, 2022 ','https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2022-03-06/939216_3090483_Untitled-1_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:36:13'),(102,102,'Taliban order TikTok, PUBG ban in entertainment crackdown',' \nKABUL: The Taliban ordered a ban against video-sharing app TikTok and the survival-shooter PlayerUnknown\'s Battlegrounds (PUBG) game on Thursday, insisting they were leading Afghanistan\'s youth astray.\nThe phone apps are popular among Afghans, who have been left with few outlets for entertainment since the group returned to power last year and banned music, movies, and television soaps.\nThe apps \"made the young generation go astray\", the cabinet said in a statement, adding the telecommunications ministry had been ordered to shut them down.\nIt also directed the ministry to stop TV channels from showing \"immoral material\", although little is being broadcast beyond news and religious content.\nDespite promising a softer version of the rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban have slowly introduced suffocating restrictions on social life — particularly for women.\nMost secondary schools for girls remain shuttered, and women are barred from many government jobs and travelling abroad — or even between cities — unless accompanied by an adult male relative.\nThe previous government of now-ousted president Ashraf Ghani had tried to ban PUBG — a battle royale first-person shooter game that is reminiscent of the book and film series \"The Hunger Games\".\nJust over 9 million people have access to the internet across Afghanistan, a country of around 38 million people, according to figures published in January from DataReportal, an independent data collector.\nThere are around 4 million social media users, with Facebook being the most popular.\nChinese-owned TikTok has been shut down twice before in neighbouring Pakistan because of alleged \"indecent\" content.\nDuring their previous regime, the Taliban\'s feared religious police banned recreational activities such as kite flying and pigeon racing.\n','\n \nThursday Apr 21, 2022 ','https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2022-04-21/412808_9171239_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:36:51'),(103,103,'Honda developing three new electric vehicle platforms by 2030','Honda Motor plans to build millions of electric vehicles (EV) by 2030 using three new dedicated platforms, with one to be jointly developed with US partner General Motors, a top executive at the Japanese automaker said.\nShinji Aoyama, Honda\'s global head of electrification, told Reuters on Thursday the firm will introduce an electric mini commercial vehicle in Japan in 2024, built on a new small EV platform.

In 2020, the company agreed to sell $1 billion in convertible bonds to private equity firm Silver Lake, a move that helped it fund a $2 billion share buyback. Twitter could choose to pursue a similar deal now with another party, raising more cash and avoiding an outright sale.\n','\n \nMonday Apr 18, 2022 ','https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2022-04-18/412207_5085726_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:39:18'),(114,114,'Musk tweets \'Love Me Tender\' days after Twitter takeover offer','Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk posted a tweet on Saturday saying \"Love Me Tender\", days after he took aim at Twitter with a $43 billion cash takeover offer.\nAfter Musk\'s TED talk on Thursday, he hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter\'s board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: \"It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote\". \nOver the weekend Musk, already the San Francisco-based company\'s second-largest shareholder after amassing a 9.1% stake in the social media firm, tweeted Twitter board\'s \"economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders\".\nTwitter on Friday adopted a \"poison pill\" to limit Musk\'s ability to raise his stake in the company. \n','\n \nMonday Apr 18, 2022 ','https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2022-04-18/412183_3817827_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:39:32'),(115,115,'Will iPhone 14 be first Apple Pencil iPhone?','The rumours about Apple Pencil have been in the air for quite some time. Every time an iPhone is about to launch, leaks come up with such rumours. These rumours had especially intensified when iPhone 11 was launched. However, none of these features was seen in any of the phones.\nThere have been rumours about iPhone Flip as well. Due to the Samsung and Apple competition, leaks often spread false rumours.\nThis is also because iPhone has four models only, meanwhile, Samsung has multiple ranges like the Galaxy A, J, S, and Z. Each of these has many phones which can be alternatives if one does not want a stylus.\nMaybe with time the stylus will become more popular and become part of the iPhone family. However, iPhone still might take time because it does not invent devices, just reforms and refines them. To adjust a stylus and create space for it can take a few years.\nIt could be that the tablet Apple Pencil becomes compatible with the phone. This will also bring multi-device functionality.\nHowever, none of this can happen anytime soon.\n','\n \nSunday Apr 17, 2022 ','https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2022-04-16/411908_9760657_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:39:44'),(116,116,'Zero Build in Fortnite brings streamers back to game ','Initially, some were not up for the idea. \n“Initially, I hated it and I was absolutely furious,” Michael “The Fierce Diva” Reynolds, a Facebook Gaming streamer, said in an interview.\nA Twitter streamer, Ali SypherPK Hassan, said, “I thought I was going to hate it. I thought maybe I would make a couple of videos about it and then move back to the usual building mode.\"\nLater, however, most people wrapped their heads around the idea. Not only have the players become comfortable with it, but those that had quit Fortnite have started coming back to it. A few examples include DrLupo, TimTheTatman, Nickmercs, and Tfue.\nReynolds even pointed out how the game had become easier to play. \"It’s easy to move around the map and pick up weapons too,\" he said.\n“I think Fortnite is showing the industry that it does not need building to be as exciting as it once was,” he added.\nHassan explained that even though Building is what initially made Fortnite successful, the game had come a long way with its collaborations with Marvel and DC.\nHassan also mentioned that the viewership on the streams remained unaffected. “My chat is really enjoying Zero Build and our viewership is besting even our recent spikes,” he said. “Fortnite with Zero Build might not be at its previous peak, but it sure feels like we’re getting there.”\n','\n \nSaturday Apr 16, 2022 ','https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2022-04-16/411890_70585_updates.jpg','24/04/2022','22:40:00'),(117,152,'Twitter bans misleading ads about climate change','','\nTech Desk \nApril 23, 2022\n','https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/AAD2534KCVMUHIB2BO2EAFLH6U1644562315-0/AAD2534KCVMUHIB2BO2EAFLH6U1644562315-0.jpg','25/04/2022','05:46:41'),(118,153,'Twitter looks into third-party apps to prevent harassment','','\nTech Desk \nApril 22, 2022\n','https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/AAD2534KCVMUHIB2BO2EAFLH6U1644562315-0/AAD2534KCVMUHIB2BO2EAFLH6U1644562315-0.jpg','25/04/2022','05:47:08'),(119,154,'Musk tears up buyout playbook with $46.5 billion Twitter financing','','\nReuters \nApril 23, 2022\n','https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1367421-elon-1490677560/1367421-elon-1490677560.jpg','25/04/2022','05:47:36'),(120,155,'Softbank-backed Ola Electric to recall 1,441 e-scooters','','\nReuters \nApril 24, 2022\n','https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Scooter1650820735-0/Scooter1650820735-0.jpg','25/04/2022','05:48:07'),(121,156,'Twitter and Stripe pilot cryptocurrency payments for creators','','\nReuters \nApril 23, 2022\n','https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1160140-Twitter-1470902146/1160140-Twitter-1470902146.jpg','25/04/2022','05:48:32'),(122,157,'Google is banning third-party recording apps on Play Store','','\nTech Desk \nApril 23, 2022\n','https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/7H4DVBEEMJPTNGGTNKLSKSHVKI1648622224-0/7H4DVBEEMJPTNGGTNKLSKSHVKI1648622224-0.jpg','25/04/2022','05:49:05');
