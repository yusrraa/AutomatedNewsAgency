# Create corpus from given documents
# ---Load, Preprocess, Dictionary and then BagofWords (gensim-downloader, simple-preprocess, doc2bow)

# Create TFIDF matrix
# ---models.TfIdf

# Create Bigrams and Trigrams (Groups of 2 & 3 words)
# --- Phraser model

# Create Word2Vec model
# -- word2vec (we would be using this one), GloVe, fasttext
# -- training of model here, divide your dataset into 2 datasets based on 80/20 ratio and train it
#    using the 80% of the dataset
# -- then update your dataset using the second dataset

# Create Doc2Vec model
# -- doc2vec, Similarly train and update the model

# Topic Modelling using LDA
# --- Prepare data--- NLTK (stopwords), Gensim(simple-preprocess, lemmatize)
# --- Create Dictionary and corpus (gensim.corpora)
# --- Train LDA model (LdaModel, LdaMulticore)


# Similarity Matrix
# -- softcosim, cosine similarity

# Create Summary
# -- gensim.summarization.summarize
