China pursued a zero-covid policy due to which multiple cities were locked down. The omicron variant, however, made it very difficult for the country to continue with this approach. On Sunday, China reported twice the number of new cases from the day before, the total reaching 3,400. This makes it the worst outbreak in two years." \
