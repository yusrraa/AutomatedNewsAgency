Tag String: ADELAIDE: Jos Buttler’s dogged resistance ended in a bizarre fashion as Australia thrashed England by 275 runs in the day-night second Test to go 2-0 up in the five-match Ashes series on Monday.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: England resumed the final day on a precarious 82-4, needing 386 more runs for an improbable win or to at least bat out the last three sessions to force a draw.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: They lost talismanic Ben Stokes in the first session and Chris Woakes fell after a fighting 44, which was the highest individual score in England’s abject second innings batting display.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Buttler, who had a wretched time behind the wicket, dropping several catches, then produced a spectacular rearguard, spread over 207 deliveries, for an uncharacteristically dogged 26 that kept alive England’s faint hopes of saving the match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: It was soon snuffed out when the batsman, retreating deep into the crease to work a Jhye Richardson delivery on the off-side, trod on his own stumps.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: For Australia, Richardson claimed 5-42 in a magnificent display of pace bowling.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “They showed some great resilience today,” Australia’s stand-in captain Steve Smith said of their opponents. “Jos played a really good innings, he faced over 200 balls. We were trying to stay as calm as we could out in the middle and just thought, a couple of good balls and a couple of wickets and we’ll keep going.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia’s Marnus Labus­chagne was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 103, the only century hit by a player from either side in the match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia were without regular captain Pat Cummins, who missed out for being a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case, and injured paceman Josh Hazlewood.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “We made mistakes throughout the game that we made last week, whether it be no-balls, missed chances,” England captain Joe Root said.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The reason it’s disappointing is because we made the same mistakes. I think we could have bowled a lot fuller, and with the bat we need to be better, make bigger scores and apply better. We just have to be better. We have to learn those lessons very quickly over the next week.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia began with their senior bowlers, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon, who have thrived in this Test in the absence of Cummins and Hazlewood.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Ollie Pope lasted seven balls, a boundary through midwicket his sole contribution, before he nicked Starc to Smith in the slips.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Smacking his bat against his foot as he walked off, Pope has had a poor tour to date and will be worried about his place for the third test.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Stokes was England’s last major hope of salvaging a draw and his batting was restrained, a sweep to the boundary off Lyon in the 55th over a highlight.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A few minutes later though, Lyon delivered a ball that replays showed to be hitting leg stump and Stokes was gone lbw for 12 runs in 110 minutes.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Buttler smacked Richardson through point for four runs off the quick’s second delivery but England highlights were otherwise sparse.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: While Buttler’s obdurate batting took England’s fight to the final session, the miracle they needed to save the match did not materialise.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “That’s the attitude we have to harness through the whole game,” Root said. “The fight and attitude was great today and we just have to do more of it.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Only one team has come from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series: Don Bradmans Australians in 1936-37. As holders of the Ashes, Australia needs only to draw the next match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The third Test begins in Melbo­urne on Sunday and Australia have named an unchanged 15-man squad for the remaining three Ashes Tests.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Hazlewood will need to prove his fitness in the Melbourne Cricket Ground nets to play the Boxing Day Test. The fourth and fifth Tests in Sydney and Hobart, respectively, are in January.

Tag String: JOHANNESBURG: No tickets will be sold to the general public for the forthcoming Test and One-day International series between South Africa and India because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Monday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: CSA said in a statement that a joint decision had been taken with the Board of Control for Cricket in India to bar spectators from the grounds in order to prevent any possible breaches of the bio-secure environment in which the matches will be played.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The first of three Tests starts in Centurion on Sunday. They will be followed by three One-day Internationals starting from Jan. 19.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement cited the increasing number of Covid-19 cases around the world and the current fourth wave of infections in South Africa for the decision.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “This decision was taken in order to avoid any breaches that could compromise the tour from a Covid-risk perspective and to also maintain a hazard-free bubble environment.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement added that the decision was made in the best interest of the game as well as the health and safety of players and staff.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement did not mention whether there had been consultations with the South African government. Current regulations allow outdoor gatherings of 2000 people.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: South Africa, where the highly mutated Omicron variant was first detected last month, is Africa’s worst-hit country according to official tallies of virus cases, with more than 3.3 million infections logged and more than 90,000 deaths.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: CSA Acting chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said: “This decision was not taken lightly but was instead taken in the best interest of the game and in the interest of the health and safety of all patrons.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: CSA informed media outlets last week that limited access to the grounds will be granted to fully-vaccinated journalists.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The matches will be broadcast on both subscription and free-to-air television channels.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Earlier on Monday, CSA announced that a Mzansi Super League Twenty20 tournament, planned for February, had been cancelled due to increased travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The tournament, originally planned as South Africa’s equivalent of the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League, was also cancelled because of Covid last season after only two editions.

Tag String: There has been opposition from European clubs, the top leagues and European governing body UEFA whose president Aleksander Ceferin has threatened to boycott any additional tournament. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Last month, a report commissioned by the World Leagues Forum said the FIFA proposal, allied with changes to the Club World Cup could cost the big domestic leagues and UEFA around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) per season in lost TV rights and match day and commercial agreements. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: UEFA, on Friday, published a report they had commissioned from consultancy firm Oliver & Ohlbaum which warned that said the changes to the international calendar would impact see revenues for European national federations drop between 2.5 and 3 billion euros ($3.38 billion) over a four year cycle. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The delegates to Monday’s summit were told that a report by Italian company Open Economics had found that domestic leagues and UEFA competitions do not have their revenues hurt by national team and international club competition. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The report said that revenue of national leagues had increased in years when a major international tournament was held. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Professor Pasquale Lucio Scandizzo, of OpenEconomics told the delegates that the plan  “promises significant and positive net macroeconomic benefits, distributed over time and space”. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A report from Nielsen predicted that the plan would see revenues rise from an expected $7 billion — for a 48 tournament — to $11.4 billion over a four year cycle thanks to increased ticket receipts and media rights and sponsorship revenues. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: FIFA officials told the delegates that $3.5 billion of the extra revenue would go to a new ‘Member Association Solidarity Fund’ with each national federation allocated around $16 million in a four year period, while extra funds would also be given to the FIFA Forward Program for development projects. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: FIFA said that the funds would help reduce the gap in revenues between the developed and less developed football markets. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Any vote on the plans would likely involve all the 211 national associations. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Along with UEFA, South American confederation CONMEBOL has opposed the proposal. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Earlier this month, Victor Montagliani, president of North and Central American and Caribbean confederation CONCACAF, said that a compromise solution could be for an additional tournament to be a revamped version of the old Confederations Cup rather than a full World Cup with a separate qualifying process.

Tag String: MADRID: Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal said on Monday he had tested positive for Covid-19, which puts in doubt his participation in the Australian Open next month where he was expected to make his big comeback after months of injury. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The Spanish former world number one said he took the test when he returned to Spain from Abu Dhabi where he took part in an exhibition tournament last week, his first since August due to a foot injury. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I am going through some unpleasant moments but I trust that I will improve little by little. I am now confined at home and have informed the people who had been in contact with me,” he wrote on Twitter. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “As a consequence of the situation, I have to have total flexibility with my calendar and I will analyse my options depending on my evolution. I will keep you informed of any decisions about my future tournaments.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The 35-year-old had been due to fly to Melbourne later this month to compete in an ATP event ahead of the Australian Open which begins at Melbourne Park on Jan 17. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The 20-time major champion has struggled with a foot injury for the past six months — forcing him to miss both Wimbledon and the US Open. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Nadal lost to another former world number one Andy Murray in an exhibition match on Friday in Abu Dhabi, his first match since August. He then lost to Wimbledon semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov of Canada on Saturday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: It was his first tournament appearance since the Citi Open in Washington in early August where he lost to Lloyd Harris.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Nadal had said the championship in Abu Dhabi was a chance to test his foot and work towards the trip Down Under in healthy conditions. “I was able to compete in both matches and even had my chances, so if we put that in perspective it’s a very positive thing,” he said after the tournament in Abu Dhabi. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The idea is to go there and try my best there in Australia. Being 100 per cent honest, I can’t guarantee it,” he added, saying he would have to speak to his team before making a final decision.

Tag String: Saying that he was the first Pakistani to have won the WBA flyweight title eliminator fight, he dubbed his win a "big thing". 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "No other Pakistani has ever achieved this before," he said, adding that before claiming the two titles in Dubai, he had won just one other title. "But now, I hold two titles at the same time." 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He, however, had a grievance. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Waseem complained that cricket was the only sport in Pakistan that received support from the country's politicians while other sports were ignored. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "It feels amazing to win, but at the same time I feel sad that nobody is ready to support us [in Pakistan]," he said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "Cricket is hardly played in 10 to 12 countries and yet when a cricketer is ranked at the top, everyone goes crazy." On the other hand, boxing is a sport played in more than 200 countries, he said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "It is very, very tough to get to the top in any weight category, and yet, when someone from [Pakistan] reaches the top spot, nobody notices,” he added.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The boxer, though, was thankful to the Pakistan Army, which he said had supported him at all times.

Tag String: Test cricketer Yasir Shah has been named in a case concerning the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl, it emerged on Monday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The case was registered against Yasir and, according to the complainant, the cricketer's friend, Farhan, under sections 292-B and 292-C (child pornography) as well as 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: In the FIR, the woman said she took her 14-year-old niece, who is a matric student, to a gathering in Lahore which was hosted by Yasir Shah, who she said was her acquaintance. She said that two to three months after returning, her niece seemed "unwell and disturbed". 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "After continuously asking her about it, she said that at Yasir's house, his friend Farhan took her mobile number and after talking to her a few times, claimed to be her friend," the complainant said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Farhan also used to make the girl talk to Yasir on WhatsApp, she said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "My niece told me that on August 14, when she was returning from tuition, Farhan made her get into a taxi and took her to a flat in F-11," the aunt said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: At the flat, Farhan sexually assaulted her at gunpoint and also made a video, according to the FIR. He told her that if she told anyone about what had happened, he would make the video go viral and kill her, the complainant said, adding that Farhan also got Yasir to threaten the teenager. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "Yasir said that he was an international and famous player and threatened her with legal action," the woman said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The aunt said that the girl later told her that Farhan blackmailed her once again, took her to a flat above a café in E-11 where he raped her a second time. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "When I heard about this, I called Yasir on WhatsApp and told him everything on September 10 or 11 at which point he was in the West Indies. Making fun [of the situation], he said that my niece was beautiful and he liked minor girls," she said, adding that the cricketer also proposed getting the teenager married off to Farhan. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "I swore at him and he [Yasir] threatened me with dire consequences, stating that he was friends with high ranking police and army officials. He threatened to implicate me in a case and to kill me," the complainant said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "When I threatened to go to the police, Yasir said let bygones be bygones and said he would buy the girl a flat and bear her expenses till she turned 18 if I got her married to Farhan," she added. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The complainant alleged that Yasir continued to threaten her through Farhan, adding that there were audio recordings of this. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “A few days ago, Yasir asked me to meet Farhan at a café in F-6. Farhan once again threatened me with dire consequences,” the complainant said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "Now Yasir is asking for a meeting on Dec 22 at his flat in Islamabad. He said that if my niece could please him, all matters would be settled, otherwise do what you will," she said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The complainant alleged that Farhan and Yasir connive to trap minor girls at their 'shisha' centre, rape them and blackmail them using videos of the incident. The aunt alleged that she, her niece and members of her family were facing death threats from the two and urged officials to take action against them. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Separately, Islamabad police said that the victim had undergone a medical examination. "The investigation will move forward in light of the circumstances and the results of the medical exam," the statement said, adding that the case will be probed on merit. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "Indiscriminate legal action will be ensured if evidence of rape comes to light," police said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also took note of the incident. Without naming Yasir, the PCB said that it had noted the allegations levelled against one of the board's "centrally contracted players". 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The PCB said that it was "presently gathering information at its end and will only offer a comment when in possession of complete facts".

So please dont judge a person as many people write FIRs just to defame someone and it is a common trend in Pakistan. We should wait for investigations to take its due course.

Tag String: Story from both sides should be heard. However even if the rape did not happen, and it is a false story, the very fact that he had any relationship with a minor itself is a charge big enough to sack him off the cricket field at least. I will find it very surprising that just out of blue, a minor girl made completely false allegations.

Tag String: Cricket South Africa to investigate Graeme Smith and Mark Boucher over racism allegations

Tag String: Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Monday that it would formally investigate director of cricket Graeme Smith and national team head coach Mark Boucher following allegations of racist conduct in an ombudsman's report. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The pair were among a number of CSA employees implicated in “tentative findings” made by the Social Justice and Nation Building Ombudsman into alleged discrimination within the sport's national governing organisation in the past. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A number of players of colour came forward to say they had been treated unfairly, with former spinner Paul Adams saying he had been called a “brown shit” in a South Africa team song during his time in the side, including by former wicket-keeper Boucher. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Boucher has since apologised. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The ombudsman report, submitted to CSA earlier this month, also criticised Smith and former national team captain AB de Villiers for selection decisions made during their time at the helm of the side, which it said were prejudicial towards Black players. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Smith and de Villiers have denied the allegation. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The Board has decided to institute formal inquiries into CSA employees, suppliers or contractors who are implicated by the report,” CSA said on Monday, adding that the process will take place after India's current test and One-Day International tour of the country. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The Board has done so mindful of its duty to treat allegations of racism or discrimination with the utmost seriousness,” it added. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The formal inquiries will be conducted by independent legal professionals. Further details with regards to the inquiries will be announced in due course. Smith and Boucher remain in their positions and will continue to carry out their duties during the India tour.”

Tag String: The One-day International (ODI) series between West Indies and Pakistan, that was scheduled to begin in Karachi on December 18 (Saturday), has been postponed and rescheduled for early June 2022 after more members of the touring party tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String:   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "On Thursday morning and as part of the PCB's Covid-19 Protocols, rapid antigen tests were conducted on the remaining 15 West Indies players and six player support personnel. All 21 members of the West Indies touring party returned negative test results. As such, Thursday’s T20I proceeded as planned," the statement said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “However, taking into consideration both teams’ welfare, as well as the limited resources in the West Indies side for the ODIs, it has been agreed that the series [...] will be postponed and rescheduled for early June 2022," the statement said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “This will provide West Indies with an equal opportunity to field their best available players for the World Cup qualification matches," it added. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement said that the members of the touring team, who had tested negative after Wednesday's PCR and Thursday's rapid antigen tests, would depart from Pakistan after the Karachi T20I. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "Those who have tested positive will complete their isolation in Karachi before their travel arrangements are finalised to allow them to rejoin their families in time for Christmas celebrations," the statement said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement added that members of the Pakistan team, who had all tested negative after Wednesday's tests, would also leave the "managed event environment" after the third T20I. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The CWI would like to thank the PCB for its excellent series arrangements and appreciates its support in rescheduling the ODI series in June 2022," the statement concluded.

Tag String: The surprise announcement came in one line at the bottom of a press release by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about the Test squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I was contacted one and a half hours before the selection meeting on the 8th for the Test series and there was no prior communication to me at all,” Kohli told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the team's departure for South Africa, where they will play three Tests and three ODIs. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Before ending the call I was told that the five selectors had decided that I would not be the ODI captain, to which I replied, 'ok fine',” the 33-year-old said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Kohli will still captain India in the Tests in South Africa but press reports suggested that he had decided to skip the subsequent ODI series in a huff. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But Kohli denied this, telling reporters on Wednesday that he “was and am available for selection” and hitting out at sections of the media for “writing lies”. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I was always keen to play,” he said.

Reason is he is unapproachable with rest teamates, demands more leaves as he is new father, wants to quit T20 captain role, yet retain ODI captainship, too many diva demands when you are jot performing as captain. Rohit is simple, has more wins and cups under his belt and extremly easy going with all teammates and approachable.

Sledging is one thing but field behavior, general body language and dealing with opponent team are different things. Kohli crossed the line many times. Even though I like him as a cricketer, the decision of BCCI to sack him as a captain is 100% right. His arrogance and his vile behavior also divided the team.

Tag String: Every player need to be handle differently.
Special players need to be sat down and discuss one problems,and they should be given respect. 
Kohli comes across as a very good person, this was shown after the loos to pakistan. Yes he can be seen on the field as very aggressive. But that brings the best out of him. He has won many matches for india, and he plays for the team. Not like Tendulkar who played for himself  scored a lot of runs, yet lost matches.

Tag String: Pakistan, ranked 13th, defeated 11th ranked South Korea 1-0 in the 4th Asian Champions Trophy Hockey Tournament here in the Malaysian city of Kuantan. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The only goal of the match came in the last minute. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The goal was scored by Haseem Khan on Pakistan's fourth penalty corner of the match. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Instead of going for a direct shot, Aleem Bilal pushed the ball towards the left side of the goal and Haseem Khan dived to flick the ball in, to give Pakistan a well deserved victory. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Unlike Thursday, when Pakistan lost the opener 2-4 to hosts Malaysia, Pakistan appeared as a well composed outfit from the outset. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: In a high octane encounter, they matched the Koreans in fitness throughout. Although, the 60 minute play saw just one goal but there were plenty of thrills in the game which saw attacking play. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Korea could not capitalise their seven penalty corners, though four of them came in quick succession. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Pakistani rushers Ejaz and Rizwan Senior halted the opponents' penalty corner strikes at the top of the circle, taking them on stick or foot. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: When the Koreans opted for an indirect drill, Pakistani defence was up to the task, with the national team displaying good team work and understanding. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Sunday will see an eagerly awaited encounter of the event as Pakistan takes on its traditional rival India.

Tag String: Pakistan is not the same team as it used to be. Pakistan used to dominate Hockey for a decade. But now ranked 13. Im suprised they won Olympics. Pakistan Hockey league is needed to rise new stars to build up. Same goes for Football, being the biggest sport in the world and Pakistan is still not taking football serious. Make people love the Sport by building football stadiums in every school and Sport Centres. It will benifit Pakistans economy and reputation.

Tag String: Kohli lost ODI captaincy as India wanted sole white-ball skipper: Ganguly

Tag String: Reuters

Tag String: Virat Kohli's decision to relinquish the 20-overs captaincy resulted in him being removed as India's one-day skipper as selectors did not want to have two different white-ball captains, Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI) chief Sourav Ganguly said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The board, which rarely explains even routine decisions, did not even mention Kohli by name in conveying the leadership change in a single sentence at the bottom of a press release announcing the Test squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The selectors were uncomfortable with the idea of having two captains for white-ball cricket.” India reached the semi-finals of the 50-overs World Cup in 2019 under Kohli but exited from the group stage at this year's Twenty20 World Cup. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: While happy to play under Rohit in the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia next year, Kohli, who remains the Test captain, was keen to lead India in the 50-overs showpiece on home soil in 2023. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “He has done well even as an ODI captain. But it was not going to be easy to have two captains in white-ball cricket with two World Cups in two years,” Ganguly said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The selectors felt the team needed one vision and varied styles of captaincy could disrupt the planning,” Ganguly said, adding that he and chief selector Chetan Sharma spoke to Kohli before making the change. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “We explained the vision to him. He understood the situation and it was only then that Rohit was named the captain of the ODI team.”

Tag String: Fading hero: The Aasif Karim story
 
Tag Name: span 
Tag String: Jarrod Kimber 
Tag Name: a 
Tag String: Twitter Share 
Tag Name: a 
Tag String:     
Tag Name: a 
Tag String: 23 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: During his evening prayers on the 16th of December 2002, Aasif Karim’s phone rang.  He did not answer it, his daughter did. The caller was Asif Papamshi, the Kenyan chairman of selectors.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Four years earlier Asif had told Aasif that he should think about retiring, the sort of way selectors tell sportsmen in a non subtle way they are about to be sacked. These two friends had barely talked since then.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Now, Asif Papamshi was calling, begging, for Aasif to come back for the 2003 World Cup.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Aasif Karim did play, and Kenya and this 39-year-old insurance broker made the semi-final of a World Cup.  In their penultimate game against the bullies of cricket and the soon to be back-to-back World Cup winners Aasif did something magnificent. After eight overs he had the figures of six maidens, two runs and three wickets. Aasif Karim did what top teams couldn’t do in that World Cup, or that era, embarrass Australia.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: This was the 23rd year of Aasif’s career, before that day, virtually no one in the world knew he played cricket, no one really noticed before that World Cup that his nation played cricket. He had been an invisible servant to an ignored team for over 20 years.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: That was his one day. To many cricket fans, it is one that they won’t ever forget. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Aasif’s career, is one of the most remarkable in cricket. He started with taking the wicket of Duncan Fletcher with his first ball in international cricket, then going on to take the wickets of Rizwan-uz-Zaman, Shoaib Mohammad, Mike Atherton, Rahul Dravid, Dilip Vengsarkar and Ricky Ponting, before facing Sachin Tendulkar on the last ball he faced for Kenya. In between he played as a junior at the French Open, was on a tennis scholarship in an American college, played Davis cup tennis and captained Kenya at the Nigerian Presidents Cup. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Aasif’s story is preceded by that of his father.  Yusif Karim, a 16-year-old immigrant in Kenya’s second city, Mombasa. One day he will have a road named after him. One day he will be known as the king of the Mombasa courts. One day he will father a cricket empire.  But for 25 straight years he won the Mombasa residents singles championship. He won it in his teens, and in his 40s.  On top of that he was good enough with the bat in hand to be offered a County Cricket opportunity.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String:   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Now Aasif’s son, Irfan Karim, is playing for the Kenyan cricket team. After only nine ODIs he has two hundreds and an average of over 40. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: All three men are featured in ‘The Karims: a sporting dynasty’ which is a documentary (and eventually will be a book) on this magnificent family. The tagline for the film is “Three Generations. Two Sports. One Family”. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The documentary is funded by Aasif Karim himself. Kenya discard their sports heroes, there are no museums of sport, no ministry of sport. This is a country with many heroes, but none they remember.  Aasif is terrified that his family’s achievements will be forgotten as many of Kenyan’s greatest athletes have been.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The documentary is in no way perfect, if you only watch high end Alex Gibney level documentaries, the lack of production values will be a real shock to you.  It is a self-funded documentary from a country without top end production values.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But the heart and the work that has gone into this film from the Karim family is what makes it connect with people. It has been nominated for film awards in India and Iran. This is almost a film about the community around this family, and the nation they come from, as much as their sporting endeavours. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Even with it being self-funded, Aasif has still managed to get sub titles into several languages, including Urdu. He wants his story to inspire others. He believes sport can change people’s lives. And has just started the Safinaz Foundation to do just that in Kenya.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Whether on or off the field, the Karims have had to overcome so many obstacles, all have given their lives for sport, despite the fact they have never made any money off it.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: This film starts when Kenya was a segregated place and Yusuf Karim was starting against the MCC and Basil D’Oliveira while signs in some of the nation’s cricket clubs still said “No Dogs, No Asians”. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The film veers from a social documentary to one that could almost be on the most dysfunctional Pakistani cricket team. It has a real heart, and should have been made by a hungry young film producer, not the family themselves. Thankfully they did make it, as this is too good a story to overlook.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Aasif Karim wants Bollywood to make his documentary into a feature film. Aasif Karim wants the President of Kenya to come to his book launch. Aasif Karim wants to build a Sports Museum in Kenya. Aasif Karim wants you to know he is proud of what his nation and his family can do. Aasif Karim wants to inspire the next generations to achieve just as much.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Much like his sporting career, if he has to do it on his own, for many decades, unpaid, most of the time being ignored, he will.  By watching his film, and telling his story to others, you can help one of the true heroes of cricket.

Kenya has produced some fine sportsmen in Hockey, Cricket and athletics. During the colonial days I remember visits of international cricket teams: Pakistan Cricket Writer's XI 1956, Sunder Cricket Team India 1957, MCC 1963, International Cavalier's XI 1963, PIA 1964. 

After Kenya's independence, cricket flourished well but sadly it has fallen prey to greedy stakeholders and businessmen who think if certain cricketing countries do not generate loads of revenue or does not have a special image then they are not worth wasting time on. Kenya with its own internal rifts among  the officials does not help improve the situation either. 

And I am wondering if the same fate holds for West Indies and Pakistan if the deteriorating decline is not arrested soon enough.

Pakistan has the same story. One person I must mention in that regard, is Air Marshall Noor Khan. Demonstrated his ability to manage large organizations (PAF, PIA, PCB, PHF ) in Pakistan with top class results, but was ignored and forgotten.

In fact, I personally know Aarif Karim, the younger bother of Asif Karim, who played league cricket under my captaincy for the University of Nevada at Reno, U.S.A. in the 1980s. 

Aarif Karim like his brother and dad was an outstanidng all-rounder as well as the best tennis player at UNR. He was also a good human being and we enjoyed his company on and off the field both as a talented cricketer and a dedicated friend.

His knowledge of the game and experience gained in over 20 years of playing international cricket for Kenya is admirable.
Yet he is not in any way involved in cricket in Kenya! 
Can Cricket Kenya afford to ignore his experience and expertise any longer?
Surely Cricket Kenya can let Aasif lead their development program to mentor the next generation of Kenyan cricketers??
I salute you my friend.

Tag String: The Windies will play three Twenty20 and three one-day internationals — all in Karachi — starting on Monday, their first visit since 2018. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A Pakistani official said a 26-member party had flown to Karachi early on Thursday before being escorted by heavy security to the team hotel. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The series comes three months after New Zealand quit their first tour to Pakistan in 18 years shortly before the opening match was due to start following a security alert. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Pakistani officials were furious with the cancellations, arguing security measures were lock-tight. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The cricket-mad nation endured a long spell without a visit from an international team following a terror attack on a bus carrying the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Pakistan were forced to play their home international matches abroad — mostly in the United Arab Emirates — until 2015 when normal service tentatively resumed. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: This West Indian squad is somewhat understrength, with regulars Evin Lewis, Shimron Hetmyer, Andre Russell and Lendl Simmons all opting out for personal reasons. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Former skipper Jason Holder is being rested, while Fabian Allen and Obed McCoy are out because of injuries. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Last week, captain Kieron Pollard also withdrew through a hamstring injury, leaving the Twenty20 leadership to Nicholas Pooran and ODIs to Shai Hope. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Four players — Akeal Hosein, Sheldon Cottrell, Dominic Drakes and Odean Smith — will join the team later on Thursday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The three T20Is are on December 13, 14 and 16, while the ODIs will be on Dec 18, 20 and 22.

Tag String: Pakistan beat West Indies by nine runs in the second Twenty20 international in Karachi on Tuesday, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: For the home team, Mohammad Rizwan top-scored for a second match running with 38 to help Pakistan get to 172-8 before keeping West Indies down to 163 all out in 20 overs. The win gives Pakistan another series with the last game on Thursday, also in Karachi. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String:   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Brendon King knocked a fluent 43-ball 67 — his maiden T20I half century — with three towering sixes and six boundaries but Pakistan bowlers were tough to handle for other batsmen. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Romario Shepherd tried to stop the inevitable with a fiery 19-ball 35 not out spiced with two sixes and as many boundaries but failed to get the required 23 off the last over. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Lanky pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-26), fellow fast bowlers Mohammad Wasim (2-39) and Haris Rauf (2-40) and spinner Mohammad Nawaz (2-36) shared the bowling honours. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: With 61 needed in the last five overs, King hoisted pacer Haris Rauf for a big six but fell next ball while attempting another maximum, caught near the long-on boundary. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Nicholas Pooran (26 off as many balls) helped King add 54 for the third wicket but Nawaz ended the partnership with Pooran holding out in the deep. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Odean Smith hit a six and a boundary in his short stay of 12 before Shaheen dismissed him off the first ball of 17th over and then removed Dominic Drakes and Hayden Walsh off successive deliveries. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: For Pakistan, Rizwan, Iftikhar Ahmed (32) and Haider Ali (31) got good starts but failed to play a big knock.
Skipper Babar Azam failed yet again, scoring just seven with a boundary before being run out off a sharp single to backward point. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Fakhar Zaman also flopped for a second match in succession when he was stumped by Pooran off spinner Akeal Hosein for ten leaving Pakistan down to 38-2. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Rizwan, who hit four boundaries and a six in his 30-ball knock, added 48 for the third wicket with Haider but both fell to medium pacer Smith who was the pick of bowlers with 2-24. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Iftikhar Ahmed smashed two sixes and a boundary in his 19-ball knock while Shadab Khan cracked three sixes and a boundary in his 12-ball 28 not out. Those fiery knocks helped Pakistan get 59 in the last five overs.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: For today's match, Pakistan retained the same playing XI as yesterday.

Tag String: Shouldn’t Shaheen Shah Afridi be taking a break from this series? Maybe because Pakistan is playing in Pakistan he wants to play but PCB management needs to ensure he gets his rest and relaxation time.

Tag String: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday named opening batsman Rohit Sharma as the new captain of the national One-day International (ODI) squad. He replaced Virat Kohli, who is now in charge of only the Test unit. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "The All-India Senior Selection Committee also decided to name Mr Rohit Sharma as the Captain of the ODI and T20I teams going forward," the BCCI tweeted. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String:   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Sharma, known for his hard-hitting style, made his debut in 2007 for the national team, initially playing only limited-overs cricket before being added to the Test team as well in 2013. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He has captained Mumbai Indians to victory in the Indian Premier League (IPL) five times. Royal Challengers Bangalore, led by Kohli until his resignation from their captaincy as well, have never won the title. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: After the World Cup, Kohli stepped down as short-format skipper in September, citing his “immense workload”, and has now yielded the ODI captaincy as well. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Many expected Kohli to lead India in the 50-overs World Cup on home soil in 2023 but the board opted for a single white-ball skipper.

Tag String: 'I am not another Imran Khan,' Mashrafe Mortaza says ahead of Bangladesh polls
 
Tag Name: span 
Tag String: AFP 
Tag Name: a 
Tag String: Twitter Share 
Tag Name: a 
Tag String:     
Tag Name: a 
Tag String: 23 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He may be Bangladesh's biggest cricket star, but Mashrafe Mortaza insists he is not another Imran Khan, Pakistan's cricketing superhero-turned-prime minister.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Contesting a seat in the national parliament for the ruling Awami League party in the December 30 elections, Mashrafe says he just wants to do more for sports and charity.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “To be honest, the level where Imran Khan has reached, people cannot always reach there even if they want to,” Mashrafe told AFP in an interview. “My desire is to do something for sports... since I am a sportsman, my wish is limited here. I will work for my region to see if I can do something good.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Mashrafe hails from the southwestern district of Narail where his charity Narail Express — also the fast-bowler's nickname — has donated ambulances to hospitals and high-yield rice seeds to farmers.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Turning to politics is nothing new for cricketers in South Asia, where the sport is massively popular. 
But unusually, Mashrafe is still playing, captains Bangladesh in the one-day format of the game, and intends to lead the team at next year's World Cup.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Mashrafe has already retired from Twenty20 international cricket and has not played a Test match since 2009.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He may also have been upstaged in the hearts of the nation's cricket fans by his teammate Shakib Al Hasan, one of the world's leading all-rounders.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But Mashrafe's die-hard attitude off the pitch — he has had seven operations on his knee — and on-field expressions of patriotism could well endear him to voters.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He also won plaudits as captain, guiding the cricket minnows to their first World Cup quarter-final in 2015.  
Tag Name: h2 
Tag String: 'Gutter-like' 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Still, when Mashrafe announced his decision to enter politics, many fans were openly critical.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Most of the comments on his social media fan pages are against him joining Bangladesh's “nasty” and “gutter-like” political arena.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Others criticised him for joining the party of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been accused of jailing opponents and stifling dissent.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But Mashrafe insists that he will not be dragged down.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “All I can say from my position is the people who are in a different party or believe in a different political belief, I don't have any disrespect for them,” he said.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Even though I'm supporting my party wholeheartedly, I have 100 percent respect for them and will continue to have it.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I'm saying this because every person has the right to support who they want to support. I can only respect the opposition from my heart, which I really do.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He also set the bar high for politicians.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Politicians should be qualified and good human beings. I'm not saying I'm already one of them though. The young people are closely seeing our social decadence. I think they should also step into politics,” he said.

Look around in the world, you will not find ONE such man who made it so big in the political arena, except Imran Khan. 

Legends and stars like Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan, Amitabh Bachan, Sunil Dutt, Dharmendra, Govinda, Shatrugan, Sachin Tendulkar, Ranatunga and countless others entered politics because of their fame and fan followings but where are they today? 

They all decided to join one of the mainstream parties because it wasn't possible for them to succeed on their own, and none of them made any considerable contribution.
