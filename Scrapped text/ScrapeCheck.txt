Tag String: Australia ace second Ashes Test despite Buttler resistance

Tag Name: p 
Tag String: ADELAIDE: Jos Buttler’s dogged resistance ended in a bizarre fashion as Australia thrashed England by 275 runs in the day-night second Test to go 2-0 up in the five-match Ashes series on Monday.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: England resumed the final day on a precarious 82-4, needing 386 more runs for an improbable win or to at least bat out the last three sessions to force a draw.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: They lost talismanic Ben Stokes in the first session and Chris Woakes fell after a fighting 44, which was the highest individual score in England’s abject second innings batting display.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Buttler, who had a wretched time behind the wicket, dropping several catches, then produced a spectacular rearguard, spread over 207 deliveries, for an uncharacteristically dogged 26 that kept alive England’s faint hopes of saving the match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: It was soon snuffed out when the batsman, retreating deep into the crease to work a Jhye Richardson delivery on the off-side, trod on his own stumps.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: For Australia, Richardson claimed 5-42 in a magnificent display of pace bowling.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “They showed some great resilience today,” Australia’s stand-in captain Steve Smith said of their opponents. “Jos played a really good innings, he faced over 200 balls. We were trying to stay as calm as we could out in the middle and just thought, a couple of good balls and a couple of wickets and we’ll keep going.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia’s Marnus Labus­chagne was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 103, the only century hit by a player from either side in the match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia were without regular captain Pat Cummins, who missed out for being a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case, and injured paceman Josh Hazlewood.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “We made mistakes throughout the game that we made last week, whether it be no-balls, missed chances,” England captain Joe Root said.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The reason it’s disappointing is because we made the same mistakes. I think we could have bowled a lot fuller, and with the bat we need to be better, make bigger scores and apply better. We just have to be better. We have to learn those lessons very quickly over the next week.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia began with their senior bowlers, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon, who have thrived in this Test in the absence of Cummins and Hazlewood.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Ollie Pope lasted seven balls, a boundary through midwicket his sole contribution, before he nicked Starc to Smith in the slips.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Smacking his bat against his foot as he walked off, Pope has had a poor tour to date and will be worried about his place for the third test.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Stokes was England’s last major hope of salvaging a draw and his batting was restrained, a sweep to the boundary off Lyon in the 55th over a highlight.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A few minutes later though, Lyon delivered a ball that replays showed to be hitting leg stump and Stokes was gone lbw for 12 runs in 110 minutes.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Buttler smacked Richardson through point for four runs off the quick’s second delivery but England highlights were otherwise sparse.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: While Buttler’s obdurate batting took England’s fight to the final session, the miracle they needed to save the match did not materialise.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “That’s the attitude we have to harness through the whole game,” Root said. “The fight and attitude was great today and we just have to do more of it.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Only one team has come from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series: Don Bradmans Australians in 1936-37. As holders of the Ashes, Australia needs only to draw the next match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The third Test begins in Melbo­urne on Sunday and Australia have named an unchanged 15-man squad for the remaining three Ashes Tests.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Hazlewood will need to prove his fitness in the Melbourne Cricket Ground nets to play the Boxing Day Test. The fourth and fifth Tests in Sydney and Hobart, respectively, are in January.

Tag String: JOHANNESBURG: No tickets will be sold to the general public for the forthcoming Test and One-day International series between South Africa and India because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Monday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: CSA said in a statement that a joint decision had been taken with the Board of Control for Cricket in India to bar spectators from the grounds in order to prevent any possible breaches of the bio-secure environment in which the matches will be played.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The first of three Tests starts in Centurion on Sunday. They will be followed by three One-day Internationals starting from Jan. 19.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement cited the increasing number of Covid-19 cases around the world and the current fourth wave of infections in South Africa for the decision.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “This decision was taken in order to avoid any breaches that could compromise the tour from a Covid-risk perspective and to also maintain a hazard-free bubble environment.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement added that the decision was made in the best interest of the game as well as the health and safety of players and staff.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement did not mention whether there had been consultations with the South African government. Current regulations allow outdoor gatherings of 2000 people.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: South Africa, where the highly mutated Omicron variant was first detected last month, is Africa’s worst-hit country according to official tallies of virus cases, with more than 3.3 million infections logged and more than 90,000 deaths.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: CSA Acting chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said: “This decision was not taken lightly but was instead taken in the best interest of the game and in the interest of the health and safety of all patrons.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: CSA informed media outlets last week that limited access to the grounds will be granted to fully-vaccinated journalists.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The matches will be broadcast on both subscription and free-to-air television channels.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Earlier on Monday, CSA announced that a Mzansi Super League Twenty20 tournament, planned for February, had been cancelled due to increased travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The tournament, originally planned as South Africa’s equivalent of the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League, was also cancelled because of Covid last season after only two editions.

Tag String: Biennial World Cup would raise extra $4.4 billion, FIFA delegates told

Tag String: ZURICH: International football leaders were told by FIFA on Monday that a switch to a biennial World Cup would create an extra $4.4 billion in revenues for the world body. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: FIFA is holding a ‘global summit’ of leaders of national football federations to discuss their proposal to increase the frequency of the World Cup from every four years to every two. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The financial data forms part of an overall feasibility study which FIFA is presenting on Monday. No vote is planned from the event which forms part of FIFA’s consultation process. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The upbeat reports are in marked contrast to analysis put forward by critics of the proposals. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: There has been opposition from European clubs, the top leagues and European governing body UEFA whose president Aleksander Ceferin has threatened to boycott any additional tournament. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Last month, a report commissioned by the World Leagues Forum said the FIFA proposal, allied with changes to the Club World Cup could cost the big domestic leagues and UEFA around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) per season in lost TV rights and match day and commercial agreements. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: UEFA, on Friday, published a report they had commissioned from consultancy firm Oliver & Ohlbaum which warned that said the changes to the international calendar would impact see revenues for European national federations drop between 2.5 and 3 billion euros ($3.38 billion) over a four year cycle. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The delegates to Monday’s summit were told that a report by Italian company Open Economics had found that domestic leagues and UEFA competitions do not have their revenues hurt by national team and international club competition. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The report said that revenue of national leagues had increased in years when a major international tournament was held. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Professor Pasquale Lucio Scandizzo, of OpenEconomics told the delegates that the plan  “promises significant and positive net macroeconomic benefits, distributed over time and space”. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A report from Nielsen predicted that the plan would see revenues rise from an expected $7 billion — for a 48 tournament — to $11.4 billion over a four year cycle thanks to increased ticket receipts and media rights and sponsorship revenues. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: FIFA officials told the delegates that $3.5 billion of the extra revenue would go to a new ‘Member Association Solidarity Fund’ with each national federation allocated around $16 million in a four year period, while extra funds would also be given to the FIFA Forward Program for development projects. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: FIFA said that the funds would help reduce the gap in revenues between the developed and less developed football markets. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Any vote on the plans would likely involve all the 211 national associations. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Along with UEFA, South American confederation CONMEBOL has opposed the proposal. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Earlier this month, Victor Montagliani, president of North and Central American and Caribbean confederation CONCACAF, said that a compromise solution could be for an additional tournament to be a revamped version of the old Confederations Cup rather than a full World Cup with a separate qualifying process.

Tag String: MADRID: Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal said on Monday he had tested positive for Covid-19, which puts in doubt his participation in the Australian Open next month where he was expected to make his big comeback after months of injury. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The Spanish former world number one said he took the test when he returned to Spain from Abu Dhabi where he took part in an exhibition tournament last week, his first since August due to a foot injury. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I am going through some unpleasant moments but I trust that I will improve little by little. I am now confined at home and have informed the people who had been in contact with me,” he wrote on Twitter. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “As a consequence of the situation, I have to have total flexibility with my calendar and I will analyse my options depending on my evolution. I will keep you informed of any decisions about my future tournaments.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The 35-year-old had been due to fly to Melbourne later this month to compete in an ATP event ahead of the Australian Open which begins at Melbourne Park on Jan 17. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The 20-time major champion has struggled with a foot injury for the past six months — forcing him to miss both Wimbledon and the US Open. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Nadal lost to another former world number one Andy Murray in an exhibition match on Friday in Abu Dhabi, his first match since August. He then lost to Wimbledon semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov of Canada on Saturday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: It was his first tournament appearance since the Citi Open in Washington in early August where he lost to Lloyd Harris.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Nadal had said the championship in Abu Dhabi was a chance to test his foot and work towards the trip Down Under in healthy conditions. “I was able to compete in both matches and even had my chances, so if we put that in perspective it’s a very positive thing,” he said after the tournament in Abu Dhabi. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The idea is to go there and try my best there in Australia. Being 100 per cent honest, I can’t guarantee it,” he added, saying he would have to speak to his team before making a final decision.
